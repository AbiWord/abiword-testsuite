About Regression Testing

Running the fully automated testsuite for AbiWord is as simple as calling

	./regression.pl
	
The results of the test are displayed on STDOUT, and can be in plain text format
or HTML, depending on the value of the $html variable located near the top
of the regression.conf configuration file.

The rest of this file describes in some more detail which tests are performed.


* Import / Export Testing
=========================

Raw Diff Test
-------------

The raw diff test is a simple test to see if a file that is imported into
abiword is converted into the same internal representation every time. Changes
that are made to an importer can result in a different awml document for
example. Some of the detected changes may be desired, others can indicate 
regressions.

This test will compare the current output of abiword --to=abw <file> against 
a stored version of the output. The comparison is done using the 'diff' command.

Note that whenever the raw diff test reports a change, it does not necessarily
mean that an error has been found. Several different cases can be identified:

- an importer has been changed, for example to fix a bug or to add a new feature. 
A change reported by the raw diff test should be examined closely to determine if 
the change includes ONLY the expected result of the change. If it includes some 
other unexpected/unwanted changes in the output as well, a regression has been found.

- AbiWord outputs awml differently, for example because of an internal change, or a 
change in the awml exporter. The raw diff test will now report changes for possible 
all exported files. In this canse no real harm has been done, and thus the change 
should not be considered as an error.

Whenever the awml output changes as expected, the raw output for every file in the 
test set should be regenerated and stored. This process is automated, and can be 
done simply by calling:

	./regenerate_raw.pl
	
After the raw output has been updated, the changes should be stored in cvs.

NOTE: make sure to have executed ./bootstrap.pl at least once before running 
      ./regenerate_raw.pl. When you have executed the regression test before,
      bootstrap.pl has already been executed for you.


Valgrind Test
--------------

This test checks for memory errors during the conversions, as well as for memoryleaks.


Adding new documents to the test set
------------------------------------

In the various subdirectories (abw, doc, rtf, etc.) of ./impexp, files can be added at 
will. Make sure to also add them to the regression.in file located in each directory (note:
you can disable specific files from being tested by commenting them out with a '#').

When you finished adding new files, enter the impexp directory and run:

	./regenerate_raw.pl

Commit the results to cvs if you want the new files to be part of the 'official' testruns.

NOTE: make sure to have executed ./bootstrap.pl at least once before running 
      ./regenerate_raw.pl. When you have executed the regression test before,
      bootstrap.pl has already been executed for you.



* Unit Testing
==============

<not implemented at the moment>


* Compilation Warning testing
=============================

This test compiles both abiword and abiword plugins, and checks if there are no 
compiler warnings. The presence of warnings could point out a true problem, so 
it is important to keep the code compiling warning free (which can be hard, given
the different compilers out there).
