<p xid="66">Evolution makes the tasks of storing, organizing, and retrieving your personal information easy, so you can work and communicate more effectively with others. It's a highly evolved <a xlink:href="#groupware" xid="67">groupware</a> program, an integral part of the Internet-connected desktop.</p>
<p xid="69">Evolution can help you work in a group by handling e-mail, address, and other contact information, and one or more calendars. It can do that on one or several computers, connected directly or over a network, for one person or for large groups.</p>
<p xid="70">With Evolution, you can accomplish your most common daily tasks quickly. For example, it takes only one or two clicks to enter appointment or contact information sent to you by e-mail, or to send e-mail to a contact or appointment. People who get lots of e-mail will appreciate advanced features like <a xlink:href="#vfolder" xid="71">search folders</a>, which let you save searches as though they were ordinary e-mail folders.</p>

<p style="Heading 1" xid="100">Using the First-Run Assistant</p>
<p xid="101">The first time you run Evolution, it creates a directory called .evolution in your home directory, where it stores all of its local data. Then, it opens a First-Run Assistant to help you set up e-mail accounts and import data from other applications.</p>

<p xid="103">Later on, if you want to change this account, or if you want to create a new one, click Edit &gt; Preferences, then click Mail Accounts. Select the account you want to change, then click Edit. Alternately, add a new account by clicking Add. See <a xlink:href="#config-prefs-mail" xid="104">Mail Preferences</a> for details.</p>

<p style="Heading 2" xid="403">Importing Mail (Optional)</p>
<p xid="404">After selecting your time zone, if Evolution finds e-mail or address files from another application, it offers to import them. For a full description of the import feature, see <a xlink:href="#importing-mail" xid="405">Importing Single Files</a>.</p>
<p xid="407">Microsoft Outlook and versions of Outlook Express after version 4 use proprietary formats that Evolution cannot read or import. To import information, you might want to use the Export tool under Windows. See the instructions in <a xlink:href="#outlook-migration-mail" xid="408">Migrating Local Outlook Mail Folders</a>.</p>
<p xid="410">Before importing e-mail from Netscape, make sure you have selected File &gt; Compact All Folders. If you don't, Evolution will import and undelete the messages in your Trash folders.</p>
<p xid="411">Evolution uses standard file types for e-mail and calendar information, so you can copy those files from your ~/.evolution directory. The file formats used are mbox for e-mail and iCal for calendar information.</p>
<p xid="412">Contacts files are stored in a database, but can be saved as a standard vCard. To export contact data, open your contacts tool and select the contacts you want to export (press Ctrl+A to select them all). Click File &gt; Save as VCard. </p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="413">Using Evolution: An Overview</p>
<p xid="414">Now that the first-run configuration has finished, you're ready to begin using Evolution. Here's a quick explanation of what's happening in your main Evolution window. </p>
<p xid="415"></p>
<p xid="416"><c style="Heading 1">Menu Bar</c></p>
<p xid="417">The menu bar gives you access to most Evolution features. For additional information, see <a xlink:href="#usage-mainwindow-menubar" xid="418">The Menu Bar</a>.</p>
<p xid="420"><c style="Heading 1">Folder List</c></p>
<p xid="421">The folder list gives you a list of the available folders for each account. To see the contents of a folder, click the folder name and the contents are displayed in the e-mail list.</p>
<p xid="422"><c style="Heading 1">Toolbar</c></p>
<p xid="423">The toolbar gives you fast and easy access to the frequently used features in each component.</p>
<p xid="424"><c style="Heading 1">Search Tool</c></p>
<p xid="425">The search tool lets you search your e-mail, contacts, calendar, and tasks to easily find what you're looking for.</p>
<p xid="426"><c style="Heading 1">Message List</c></p>
<p xid="427">The message list displays a list of e-mail that you have received. To view an e-mail in the preview pane, click the e-mail in the e-mail list.</p>
<p xid="428"><c style="Heading 1">Shortcut Buttons</c></p>
<p xid="429">The shortcut bar lets you switch between folders and between Evolution tools. At the bottom of the shortcut bar there are buttons that let you switch tools, and above that is a list of all the available folders for the current tool. If you have the Evolution Connector for Microsoft Exchange installed, you have an Exchange button in addition to buttons for the other tools. For additional information, see <a xlink:href="#usage-mainwindow-shortcutbar" xid="430">The Shortcut Bar</a>.</p>
<p xid="432"><c style="Heading 1">Status Bar</c></p>
<p xid="433">The status bar periodically displays a message, or tells you the progress of a task. This most often happens when you're checking or sending e-mail. These progress queues are shown in the previous figure. The Online/Offline indicator is here, too, in the lower left of the window.</p>
<p xid="434"><c style="Heading 1">Preview Pane</c></p>
<p xid="435">The preview pane displays the contents of the e-mail that is selected in the e-mail list.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="436">The Menu Bar</p>
<p xid="437">The menu bar's contents always provide all the possible actions for any given view of your data. If you're looking at your Inbox, most of the menu items relate to e-mail. Some content relates to other components of Evolution and some, especially in the File menu, relates to the application as a whole. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="438">File: </p>
<p xid="439">Anything related to a file or to the operations of the application is listed in this menu, such as creating things, saving them to disk, printing them, and quitting the program itself. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="440">Edit: </p>
<p xid="441">Holds useful tools that help you edit text and move it around. Lets you access the settings and configuration options in the Edit menu.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="442">View: </p>
<p xid="443">Lets you decide how Evolution should look. Some of the features control the appearance of Evolution as a whole, and others the way a particular kind of information appears. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="444">Folder: </p>
<p xid="445">Holds actions that can be performed on folders. You can find things like copy, rename, delete, and so on.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="446">Message: </p>
<p xid="447">Holds actions that can be applied to a message. If there is only one target for the action, such as replying to a message, you can normally find it in the Message menu.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="448">Search: </p>
<p xid="449">Lets you search for messages, or for phrases within a message. You can also see previous searches you have made. In addition to the Search menu, there is a text entry box in the toolbar that you can use to search for messages. You can also create a search folder from a search.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="450">Help: </p>
<p xid="451">Opens the Evolution Help files.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="452">The Shortcut Bar</p>
<p xid="453">The most important job for Evolutions is to give you access to your information and help you use it quickly. One way it does that is through the shortcut bar, which is the column on the left side of the main window. The buttons, such as Mail and Contacts, are the shortcuts. Above them is a list of folders for the current Evolution tool.</p>
<p xid="454">The folder list organizes your e-mail, calendars, contact lists, and task lists in a tree, similar to a <a xlink:href="#filetree" xid="455">file tree</a>. Most people find one to four folders at the base of the tree, depending on the tool and their system configuration. Each Evolution tool has at least one folder, called On This Computer, for local information. For example, the folder list for the e-mail tool shows any remote e-mail storage you have set up, plus local folders and search folders, which are discussed in <a xlink:href="#usage-mail-organize-vfolders" xid="457">Using Search Folders</a>. </p>
<p xid="459">If you get large amounts of e-mail, you might want more folders than just your Inbox. You can create multiple calendar, task, or contacts folders. </p>
<p xid="460">To create a new folder:</p>
<p xid="461">Click Folder &gt; New.</p>
<p xid="462">Type the name of the folder in the Folder Name field.</p>
<p xid="463">Select the location of the new folder.</p>
<p xid="464">Click OK.</p>
<p style="Heading 2" xid="465">Folder Management</p>
<p xid="466">Right-click a folder or subfolder to display a menu with the following options:</p>
<p style="Heading 2" xid="467">Copy: </p>
<p xid="468">Copies the folder to a different location. When you select this item, Evolution offers a choice of locations to copy the folder to.</p>
<p style="Heading 2" xid="469">Move: </p>
<p xid="470">Moves the folder to another location. </p>
<p style="Heading 2" xid="471">Mark Messages As Read: </p>
<p xid="472">Marks all the messages in the folder as read.</p>
<p style="Heading 2" xid="473">New Folder: </p>
<p xid="474">Creates another folder in the same location. </p>
<p style="Heading 2" xid="475">Delete: </p>
<p xid="476">Deletes the folder and all its contents. </p>
<p style="Heading 2" xid="477">Rename: </p>
<p xid="478">Lets you change the name of the folder. </p>
<p style="Heading 2" xid="479">Disable: </p>
<p xid="480">Disables the account.</p>
<p style="Heading 2" xid="481">Properties: </p>
<p xid="482">Checks the number of total and unread messages in a folder, and, for remote folders, lets you select whether to copy the folder to your local system for offline operation.</p>
<p xid="483">You can also rearrange folders and messages by dragging and dropping them.</p>
<p xid="484">Any time new e-mail arrives in a e-mail folder, that folder label is displayed in bold text, along with the number of new messages in that folder.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="485">E-Mail</p>
<p xid="486">Evolution e-mail is like other e-mail programs in several ways:</p>
<p xid="487">It can send and receive e-mail in HTML or as plain text, and makes it easy to send and receive multiple file attachments. </p>
<p xid="488">It supports multiple e-mail sources, including <a xlink:href="#imap" xid="489">IMAP</a>, <a xlink:href="#pop" xid="491">POP3</a>, and local mbox or mh spools and files created by other e-mail programs.</p>
<p xid="493">It can sort and organize your e-mail in a wide variety of ways with folders, searches, and filters. </p>
<p xid="494">It lets you guard your privacy with encryption.</p>
<p xid="495">However, Evolution has some important differences from other e-mail programs. First, it's built to handle very large amounts of e-mail. The <a xlink:href="#usage-mail-organize-spam" xid="496">junk e-mail</a>, message <a xlink:href="#usage-mail-organize-filters" xid="498">filtering</a> and <a xlink:href="#usage-mail-organize-search" xid="500">searching</a> functions were built for speed and efficiency. There's also the <a xlink:href="#usage-mail-organize-vfolders" xid="502">search folder</a>, an advanced organizational feature not found in some e-mail clients. If you get a lot of e-mail, or if you keep every message you get in case you need to refer to it later, you'll find this feature especially useful. Here's a quick explanation of what's happening in your main Evolution e-mail window. </p>
<p xid="504"></p>
<p xid="505"><c style="Heading 1">Message List</c></p>
<p xid="506">The message list displays all the e-mails that you have. This includes all your read and unread messages, and e-mail that is flagged to be deleted.</p>
<p xid="507"><c style="Heading 1">Preview Pane</c></p>
<p xid="508">This is where your e-mail is displayed.</p>
<p xid="509">If you find the preview pane too small, you can resize the pane, enlarge the whole window, or double-click the message in the message list to have it open in a new window. To change the size of a pane, drag the divider between the two panes. </p>
<p xid="510">As with folders, you can right-click messages in the message list and get a menu of possible actions, including moving or deleting them, creating filters or search folders based on them, and marking them as junk mail.</p>
<p xid="511">Most of the e-mail-related actions you want to perform are listed in the Actions menu in the menu bar. The most frequently used ones, like Reply and Forward, also appear as buttons in the toolbar. Most of them are also located in the right-click menu and as keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p xid="512">For an in-depth guide to the e-mail capabilities of Evolution, read <a xlink:href="#usage-mail" xid="513">Sending and Receiving E-Mail</a>.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="515">The Calendar</p>
<p xid="516">To begin using the calendar, click Calendar in the shortcut bar. By default, the calendar shows today's schedule on a ruled background. At the upper right, there's a monthly calendar you can use to switch days. Below that, there's a Task list, where you can keep a list of tasks separate from your calendar appointments.</p>
<p xid="517"></p>
<p xid="518"><c style="Heading 1">Appointment List</c></p>
<p xid="519">The appointment list displays all your scheduled appointments.</p>
<p xid="520"><c style="Heading 1">Month Pane</c></p>
<p xid="521">The month pane is a small view of a calendar month. To display additional months, drag the column border to the left. You can also select a range of days in the month pane to display a custom range of days in the appointment list.</p>
<p xid="522"><c style="Heading 1">Task List</c></p>
<p xid="523">Tasks are distinct from appointments because they generally don't have times associated with them. You can see a larger view of your task list by clicking Tasks in the shortcut bar.</p>
<p xid="524">For more information about the calendar, see <a xlink:href="#usage-calendar" xid="525">Evolution Calendar</a>.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="527">The Contacts Tool</p>
<p xid="528">The Evolution contacts tool can handle all of the functions of an address book or phone book. However, it's easier to update Evolution than it is to change an actual paper book, in part because Evolution can synchronize with Palm OS devices and use <a xlink:href="#ldap" xid="529">LDAP</a> directories on a network.</p>
<p xid="531">Another advantage of the Evolution contacts tool is its integration with the rest of the application. For example, you can right-click an e-mail address in Evolution mail to instantly create a contact entry.</p>
<p xid="532">To use the contacts tool, click Contacts in the shortcut bar. By default, the display shows all your contacts in alphabetical order, in a minicard view. You can select other views from the View menu, and adjust the width of the columns by clicking and dragging the gray column dividers.</p>
<p xid="533">The contacts tool looks like this:</p>
<p xid="534"></p>
<p xid="535"><c props="font-style:italic">Contact list</c></p>
<p xid="536">The largest section of the contacts display shows a list of individual contacts. You can also search the contacts in the same way that you search e-mail folders, using the search tool on the right side of the toolbar.</p>
<p xid="537">For detailed instructions on how to use the address book, read <a xlink:href="#usage-contact" xid="538">Evolution Contacts: the Address Book</a>.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="540">Command Line Options</p>
<p xid="541">Evolution has a number of command line options that you can use. You can find the full list by entering the command man evolution or evolution --help. The most important command line options are: </p>

<p style="Section Heading" xid="616">Reading Mail</p>
<p xid="617">If you are not already viewing mail, switch to the mail tool by clicking the Mail shortcut button, or press Ctrl+1. To read a message, select it in the message list; if you'd like to see it in its own window, either double-click it, press Enter, or press Ctrl+O.</p>
<p xid="618">To read mail with the keyboard, you can click the Spacebar to page down while you're reading an e-mail, and press Backspace to page up in an e-mail. </p>
<p xid="619">Navigate the message list by using the arrow keys on the keyboard. To go to the next and previous unread messages, press the period (.) or comma (,) keys. On most keyboards, these keys are also marked with the &gt; and &lt; symbols, which is a convenient way to remember that they move you forward and backward in your message list. You can also use the right square bracket (]) for the next unread message, and the left square bracket ([) for the previous unread message.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="620">Sorting the Message List</p>
<p xid="621">Evolution helps you work by letting you sort your e-mail. To sort by sender, subject, or date, click the bars with those labels at the top of the message list. The direction of the arrow next to the label indicates the direction of the sort. Click again, to sort them in reverse order. For example, click Date to sort messages by date from oldest to newest. Click again, and Evolution sorts the list from newest to oldest. You can also right-click the message header bars to get a set of sorting options, and to add or remove columns from the message list. You can find detailed instructions on how to customize your message display columns in <a xlink:href="#usage-mail-organize-columns" xid="622">Sorting Mail with Column Headers</a>.</p>
<p xid="624">To look at the complete headers for a message, click View &gt; Message Display &gt; Show Full Headers. To see all message data, click View &gt; Message Display &gt; Show E-Mail Source. </p>
<p xid="625">You can also choose a threaded message view. Click View &gt; Threaded Message List to turn the threaded view on or off. When you select this option, Evolution groups the replies to a message with the original, so you can follow the thread of a conversation from one message to the next.</p>
<p xid="626"></p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="627">Deleting Mail</p>
<p xid="628">After you read your mail, you might want to delete it. To delete a message, select it and press the Delete key, click the Trash button, press Ctrl+D, or right-click the message, then click Delete. </p>
<p xid="629">When you press Delete or click the Trash button, your mail isn't actually deleted, but is marked for deletion. Your e-mail is recoverable until you have expunged your mail. When you expunge a folder, you remove all the mail that you have marked for deletion. To show deleted messages, click View &gt; Hide Deleted Messages. You can also find deleted messages in the your Trash folder. </p>
<p xid="630">To permanently erase all the deleted messages in a folder, click Folder &gt; Expunge or press Ctrl+E.</p>
<p xid="631">Both local and IMAP Trash folders are actually search folders that display all messages you have marked for later deletion. For more information about search folders, see <a xlink:href="#usage-mail-organize-vfolders" xid="632">Using Search Folders</a>. Because emptying your trash expunges the messages in your Trash folder, emptying Trash is the same as expunging deleted mail from all your folders.</p>
<p xid="634">However, this is not true for the Trash folder on Exchange servers, which behaves just the same as it does in Outlook. It is a normal folder with actual messages in it.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="635">Undeleting Messages</p>
<p xid="636">You can undelete a message that has been deleted but not expunged. To undelete a message, select the message, then press Ctrl+U, or click Edit &gt; Undelete.</p>
<p xid="637">If you have marked a message for deletion, undeleting it unmarks it, and the message is removed from the Trash folder. You cannot undelete messages that have been expunged. </p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="638">Checking for New Mail</p>
<p xid="639">To check your mail, click Send/Receive in the toolbar. If you haven't created any mail accounts yet, the setup assistant asks you for the information it needs to check your e-mail. For information on creating mail accounts, see <a xlink:href="#usage-mainwindow-starting" xid="640">Starting Evolution for the First Time</a>.</p>
<p xid="642">If this is your first time checking mail, or you haven't asked Evolution to store your password, you are prompted for the password. Enter your password to download your e-mail.</p>
<p xid="643">If you get an error message instead of mail, you probably need to check your network settings. To learn how to do that, see <a xlink:href="#config-prefs-mail" xid="644">Mail Preferences</a>, or ask your system administrator. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="646">Sharing Mailboxes with Other Mail Programs</p>
<p xid="647">If you want to use Evolution and another e-mail client, such as Mutt, at the same time, use the following procedure:</p>
<p xid="648">Download your mail in the other application as you would normally.</p>
<p xid="649">In Evolution, click Edit &gt; Preferences, then click Mail Accounts. Select the account you want to use to share mail and click Edit. Instead of Edit, you might want to create a new account just for this source of mail by clicking New.</p>
<p xid="650">Under the Receiving Mail tab, select the type of mail file that your other mail application uses, then specify the full path to that location. A typical choice would be mbox files, with the path /home/username/Mail/.</p>
<p xid="651">Click OK.</p>
<p xid="652">You can only use one mail client at a time. The mail files are locked by the mail program that is currently using them, so the mail files can't be accessed by any other mail program.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="653">Using Evolution for News</p>
<p xid="654">USENET newsgroups are similar to mail, so it's often convenient to read news and mail side by side. You can add a news source, called an NNTP server, the same way you would a <a xlink:href="#bse54o0" xid="655">new e-mail account</a>, selecting USENET News as the source type. The news server appear as a remote mail server, and each news group works like an IMAP folder. When you click Send/Receive, Evolution also checks for news messages.</p>
<p xid="657">When you create a news group account, you are not subscribed to any groups. To subscribe to a news group:</p>
<p xid="658">Click Folder &gt; Subscriptions.</p>
<p xid="659">Select your NNTP account, select the groups you want to subscribe to, then click Subscribe.</p>
<p xid="660">Click Close.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="661">Working with Attachments and HTML Mail</p>
<p xid="662">If someone sends you an <a xlink:href="#attachment" xid="663">attachment</a>, Evolution displays a file icon at the end of the message to which it's attached. Text, including HTML formatting and embedded images, appears as part of the message, rather than as a separate attachment. Attachments are also listed on the top bar of the message. To view the attachments, click the arrow to expand the attachment window. To open an attachment, double-click the it. Click the Save All button save all the attachments.</p>
<p style="Heading 2" xid="665">Saving or Opening Attachments</p>
<p xid="666">If you get an e-mail message with an attachment, Evolution can help you save the attachment or open it with the appropriate applications.</p>
<p xid="667">Evolution shows a right-arrow icon, the number of attachments, and a Save or Save All button to save all the attachments. Click the right-arrow icon to show the attachment bar.</p>
<p xid="668">To save an attachment to disk:</p>
<p xid="669">Click the down-arrow on the attachment icon, or right-click the attachment icon in the attachment bar, then click Save As.</p>
<p xid="670">Select a location and name for the file.</p>
<p xid="671">Click OK.</p>
<p xid="672">To open an attachment using another application: </p>
<p xid="673">Click the down-arrow on the attachment icon or right-click the attachment icon in the attachment bar</p>
<p xid="674">Select the application to open the attachment.</p>
<p xid="675">Click OK.</p>
<p xid="676">The options available for an attachment vary depending on the type of attachment and the applications your system has installed. For example, attached word processor files can be opened in OpenOffice.org or another word processor, and compressed archive files can be opened in the File Roller application.</p>
<p style="Heading 2" xid="677">Inline Images in HTML Mail</p>
<p xid="678">When someone sends you HTML mail that includes an image in the body of the message (for example, the welcome message in your Inbox), Evolution displays the image inside the message. You can create messages like this by using the Insert Image tool in the message composer. Alternately, just drag an image into the message composition area.</p>
<p xid="679">Some images are links in a message, rather than being part of the message. Evolution can download those images from the Internet, but does not do so unless you request it. This is because remotely hosted images can be slow to load and display, and can even be used by spammers to track who reads the e-mail. Not automatically loading images helps protect your privacy.</p>
<p xid="680">To load the images for one message:</p>
<p xid="681">Click View &gt; Load Images.</p>
<p xid="682">To set the default action for loading images:</p>
<p xid="683">Click Edit &gt; Preferences, then click Mail Preference.</p>
<p xid="684">Click the HTML Mail tab.</p>
<p xid="685">Select one of the items: Never Load Images Off the Net, Load Images in Mail From Contacts, or Always Load Images Off the Net.</p>
<p xid="686">Click Close.</p>
<p xid="687">If you use an HTTP proxy (as in many large organizations), Evolution must be able to find it through the gnome-vfs subsystem before it can load images from the Internet.</p>
<p xid="688"> To set your proxy in KDE:</p>
<p xid="689">Click the menu icon &gt; System &gt; Configuration &gt; Yast.</p>
<p xid="690">Click Network Services, then click Proxy.</p>
<p xid="691">Specify your proxy settings (if you don't know your proxy settings, contact your ISP or system administrator).</p>
<p xid="692">Click Finish, then click Close.</p>
<p xid="693">To set your proxy in GNOME:</p>
<p xid="694">Click System &gt; Administrative Settings (enter your root password if needed).</p>
<p xid="695">Click Network Services, then click Proxy.</p>
<p xid="696">Specify your proxy settings (if you don't know your proxy settings, contact your ISP or system administrator).</p>
<p xid="697">Click Finish, then click Close.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="698">Composing New E-Mail Messages</p>
<p xid="699">You can start writing a new e-mail message by clicking File &gt; New &gt; Mail Message, by pressing Ctrl+N when in the mailing tool, or by clicking New in the toolbar.</p>
<p xid="700"></p>
<p xid="701">Enter an address in the To field. If you want, enter a subject in the Subject field, and a message in the box at the bottom of the window. After you have written your message, click Send.</p>
<p xid="702">This section contains the following topics:</p>

<p style="Heading 1" xid="739">Unicode, ASCII, and Non-Latin Alphabets</p>
<p xid="740">If you want to write in a non-Latin alphabet while using a Latin keyboard, try selecting a different input method in the message composer. Right-click in the message composition area and select an input method from the Input Methods menu, then begin typing. The actual keys vary by language and input style. For example, the Cyrillic input method uses transliterated Latin keyboard combinations to get the Cyrillic alphabet, combining letters where necessary. Zh and ya produce the appropriate single Cyrillic letters, and the single-quote () produces a soft sign character.</p>
<p xid="741">For greater language display capabilities, click Edit &gt; Preferences, then select the character set choices in the Mail Preferences and Composer Preferences sections. If you aren't sure which one to use, select UTF-8, which offers the greatest range of character displays for the greatest range of languages.</p>
<p style="Heading 2" xid="742">Using Character Sets</p>
<p xid="743">A character set is a computer's version of an alphabet. In the past, the ASCII character set was used almost universally. However, it contains only 128 characters, meaning it is unable to display characters in Cyrillic, Kanjii, or other non-Latin alphabets. To work around language display problems, programmers developed a variety of methods, so many human languages now have their own specific character sets, and items written in other character sets display incorrectly. Eventually, standards organizations developed the UTF-8 Unicode character set to provide a single compatible set of codes for everyone.</p>
<p xid="744">Most e-mail messages state in advance which character set they use, so Evolution usually knows what to display for a given binary number. However, if you find that messages are displayed as rows of incomprehensible characters, try selecting a different character set in the mail settings screen. If your recipients can't read your messages, try selecting a different character set in the composer options dialog box. For some languages, such as Turkish or Korean, it might work best for you to select the language-specific character set. However, the best choice for most users is UTF-8, which offers the widest range of characters for the widest range of languages.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="745">Sending Composed Messages Later</p>
<p xid="746">Evolution normally sends mail as soon as you click Send. However, can save a message to be sent later:</p>
<p xid="747">If you are offline when you click Send, Evolution adds your message to the Outbox queue. The next time you connect to the Internet and send or receive mail, that message is sent.</p>
<p xid="748">Click File &gt; Save Draft to store your messages in the drafts folder for later revision. </p>
<p xid="749">If you prefer to save your message as a text file, click File &gt; Save As, then specify a filename. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="750">Working Offline</p>
<p xid="751">Offline mode is a tool designed for use with remote mail storage systems like GroupWise, IMAP or Exchange, in situations where you are not connected to the network at all times. The tool keeps a local copy of one or more folders to allow you to compose messages, storing them in your Outbox to be sent the next time you connect.</p>
<p xid="752">POP mail downloads all messages to your local system, but other connections usually download just the headers, and get the rest only when you want to read the message. Before you go offline, Evolution downloads the unread messages from the folders you have chosen to store.</p>
<p xid="753">To mark a folder for offline use, right-click the folder, then click Properties. Click Copy Folder Content Locally for Offline Operation.</p>
<p xid="754">Your connection status is shown by the small icon in the lower left border of the Evolution main window. When you are online, it displays two connected cables. When you go offline, the cables separate. </p>
<p xid="755">To cache your selected folders and disconnect from the network, click File &gt; Work Offline, or click the connection status icon in the lower left of the screen. When you want to reconnect, click File &gt; Work Online, or click the connection status icon again.</p>
<p style="Heading 2" xid="756">Automatic Network State Handling</p>
<p xid="757">Evolution automatically understands the network state and acts accordingly. For instance, Evolution switches to offline mode when the network goes down and automatically switches on when the network is up again. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="758">Attachments</p>
<p xid="759">To attach a file to your e-mail:</p>
<p xid="760">Click the Attach icon in the composer toolbar.</p>
<p xid="761">Select the file you want to attach.</p>
<p xid="762">Click OK.</p>
<p xid="763">You can also drag a file into the composer window. If you want to send it as an inline attachment, right-click the attachment and click Properties, then select Automatic Display of Attachments. </p>
<p xid="764">When you send the message, a copy of the attached file goes with it. Be aware that large attachments can take a long time to send and receive.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="765">Specifying Additional Recipients for E-Mail</p>
<p xid="766">Evolution, like most e-mail programs, recognizes three types of addressee: primary recipients, secondary recipients, and hidden (blind) recipients. The simplest way to direct a message is to put the e-mail address or addresses in the To: field, which denotes primary recipients. Use the Cc: field to send a message to secondary recipients.</p>
<p xid="767">Addresses on the Bcc: list are hidden from the other recipients of the message. You can use it to send mail to large groups of people, especially if they don't know each other or if privacy is a concern. If your Bcc: field is absent, click View &gt; Bcc Field. </p>
<p xid="768">If you frequently write e-mail to the same groups of people, you can create address lists in the contacts tool, and then send them mail as though they have a single address. To learn how to do that, see <a xlink:href="#usage-contact-organize-group-list" xid="769">Creating a List of Contacts</a>.</p>
<p xid="771">Evolution has the ability to let you specify the Reply-To in an e-mail. Using this, you can set up a special Reply-To for an e-mail. To do this:</p>
<p xid="772">Open a compose window.</p>
<p xid="773">Open the Reply-To field by clicking View &gt; Reply To.</p>
<p xid="774">Specify the address you want as the Reply-To address in the new Reply-To field.</p>
<p xid="775">Complete the rest of your message. </p>
<p xid="776">Click Send.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="777">Choosing Recipients Quickly</p>
<p xid="778">If you have created address cards in the contacts tool, you can also type nicknames or other portions of address data, and Evolution displays a drop-down list of possible address completions from your contacts. If you type a name or nickname that can go with more than one card, Evolution opens a dialog box to ask you which person you meant.</p>
<p xid="779">If Evolution does not complete addresses automatically, click Edit &gt; Preferences, then click Autocompletion. There, select the groups of contacts you want to use for address autocompletion in the mailer. </p>
<p xid="780">Alternately, you can click the To:, Cc:, or Bcc: buttons to get a list of the e-mail addresses in your contacts. Select addresses and click the arrows to move them into the appropriate address columns.</p>
<p xid="781">For more information about using e-mail with the contact manager and the calendar, see <a xlink:href="#contact-automation-basic" xid="782">Send Me a Card: Adding New Cards Quickly</a> and <a xlink:href="#usage-calendar-apts" xid="784">Scheduling With the Evolution Calendar</a>.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="786">Replying to E-Mail Messages</p>
<p xid="787">To reply to a message, click the message to reply to in the e-mail list and click Reply, or right-click within the message and select Reply to Sender. This opens the message composer. The To: and Subject: fields are already filled, although you can alter them if you prefer. In addition, the full text of the old message is inserted into the new message, either in grey with a blue line on one side (for HTML display) or with the &gt; character before each line (in plain text mode), to indicate that it's part of the previous message.</p>
<p xid="788">If you're reading a message with several recipients, you can use Reply to All instead of Reply. If there are large numbers of people in the Cc: or To: fields, this can save substantial amounts of time.</p>
<p style="Heading 2" xid="789">Using the Reply To All Feature</p>
<p xid="790">Susan sends an e-mail to a client and sends copies to Tim and to an internal company mailing list of co-workers. If Tim wants to make a comment for all of them to read, he uses Reply to All, but if he just wants to tell Susan that he agrees with her, he uses Reply. His reply does not reach anyone that Susan put on her Bcc list, because that list is not shared with anyone.</p>
<p xid="791">If you subscribe to a mailing list, and want your reply to go just to the list, rather than to the sender, select Reply to List instead of Reply or Reply to All. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="792">Searching and Replacing with the Composer</p>
<p xid="793">The message composer makes several text searching features available to you.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="794">Find: </p>
<p xid="795">Enter a word or phrase, and Evolution finds it in your message.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="796">Find Regex: </p>
<p xid="797">You can search for a complex pattern of characters, called a <a xlink:href="#regular-expression" xid="798">regular expression</a> or regex in your composer window. If you're not sure what a regular expression is, you should ignore this feature.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="800">Find Again: </p>
<p xid="801">Select this item to repeat the last search you performed. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="802">Replace: </p>
<p xid="803">Find a word or phrase, and replace it with something else.</p>
<p xid="804">For all of these menu items, you can choose whether to search backwards in the document from the point where your cursor is. You can also determine whether the search is to be case sensitive in determining a match.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="805">Enhancing Your E-Mail with HTML</p>
<p xid="806">Normally, you can't set text styles or insert pictures in e-mail. However, most newer e-mail programs can display images and text styles in addition to basic alignment and paragraph formatting. They do this with <a xlink:href="#html" xid="807">HTML</a>, just like Web pages do.</p>
<p xid="809">Some people do not have HTML-capable mail clients, or prefer not to receive HTML-enhanced mail because it is slower to download and display. Because of this, Evolution sends plain text unless you explicitly ask for HTML. </p>
<p style="Heading 2" xid="810">Basic HTML Formatting</p>
<p xid="811">You can change the format of an e-mail message from plain text to HTML by choosing Format HTML.</p>
<p xid="812">To send all your mail as HTML by default, set your mail format preferences in the mail configuration dialog box. See <a xlink:href="#config-prefs-mail-composer" xid="813">Composer Preferences</a> for more information.</p>
<p xid="815">HTML formatting tools are located in the toolbar just above the space where you actually compose the message. They also appear in the Insert and Format menus.</p>
<p xid="816">The icons in the toolbar are explained in <a xlink:href="#tooltip" xid="817">tool-tips</a>, which appear when you hold your mouse pointer over the buttons. The buttons fall into five categories: </p>
<p style="Heading 2" xid="819">Headers and Lists: </p>
<p xid="820">At the left edge of the toolbar, you can choose Normal for a default text style or Header 1 through Header 6 for varying sizes of header from large (1) to tiny (6). Other styles include preformat, to use the HTML tag for preformatted blocks of text, and three types of bullet points for lists.</p>
<p xid="821">For instance, instead of using asterisks to mark a bulleted list, you can use the Bulleted List style from the style drop-down list. Evolution uses different bullet styles, and handles word wrap and multiple levels of indentation.</p>
<p style="Heading 2" xid="822">Text Styles: </p>
<p xid="823">Use these buttons to determine the way your e-mail looks. If you have text selected, the style applies to the selected text. If you do not have text selected, the style applies to whatever you type next.</p>

<p style="Heading 1" xid="895">Read Receipts:</p>
<p xid="896"> Evolution allows you to request a receipt for your sent messages to indicate when your message is being viewed by the recipient. Receipts are useful when sending e-mail that is time-sensitive. To request a receipt, click Insert &gt; Request Read Receipt in the composer window.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="897">Prioritize Message: </p>
<p xid="898">You can prioritize a message to be sent, so that the recipient sees its relative importance. To prioritize a message, click Insert &gt; Prioritize Message in the composer window. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="899">Forwarding Mail</p>
<p xid="900">When you receive an e-mail, you can forward it to other individuals or groups that might be interested. You can forward a message as an attachment to a new message (this is the default) or you can send it <a xlink:href="#inline" xid="901">in line</a> as a quoted portion of the message you are sending. Attachment forwarding is best if you want to send the full, unaltered message to someone else. Inline forwarding is best if you want to send portions of a message, or if you have a large number of comments on different sections of the message you are forwarding. Remember to note from whom the message came, and whether you have removed or altered content.</p>
<p xid="903">To forward a message you are reading: </p>
<p xid="904">Click Forward on the toolbar.</p>
<p xid="905">or</p>
<p xid="906">If you prefer to forward the message <a xlink:href="#inline" xid="907">inline</a> instead of attached, click Actions &gt; Forward Inline from the menu.</p>
<p xid="909">Select an addressee as you would when sending a new message; the subject is already entered, although you can alter it if you want.</p>
<p xid="910"> Add your comments on the message in the composition frame, then click Send.</p>
<p xid="911">Attachments to a message you are forwarding are forwarded only when you send the original message as an attachment. Inline messages do not forward any attachments.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="912">Tips for E-Mail Courtesy</p>
<p xid="913">Don't forward chain letters. If you must, watch out for hoaxes and urban legends, and make sure the message doesn't have multiple layers of greater-than signs, (&gt;) indicating multiple layers of careless in-line forwarding. </p>
<p xid="914">Always begin and close with a salutation. Say please and thank you, just like you do in real life. You can keep your pleasantries short, but be polite. </p>
<p xid="915">WRITING IN CAPITAL LETTERS MEANS YOU'RE SHOUTING! Don't write a whole message in capital letters. It hurts people's ears. </p>
<p xid="916">Check your spelling and use complete sentences. By default, Evolution puts a red line beneath words it doesn't recognize, as you type them. </p>
<p xid="917">Don't send nasty e-mails (flames). If you get one, don't write back. </p>
<p xid="918">When you reply or forward, include enough of the previous message to provide context.</p>
<p xid="919">Don't send spam.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="920">Sending Invitations by Mail</p>
<p xid="921">If you create an event in the calendar component, you can then send invitations to the attendee list through the Evolution e-mail tool. The invitation card is sent as an attachment in iCal format.</p>
<p xid="922">When you receive an invitation, you have several options:</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="923">Accept: </p>
<p xid="924">Indicates you will attend the meeting. When you click the OK button, the meeting is entered into your calendar.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="925">Tentatively Accept: </p>
<p xid="926">Indicates you will probably attend the meeting. When you click the OK button, the meeting is entered into your calendar, but is marked as tentative.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="927">Decline: </p>
<p xid="928">Indicates you are unable to attend the meeting. The meeting is not entered into your calendar when you click OK, although your response is sent to the meeting host if you have selected the RSVP option.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="929">RSVP: </p>
<p xid="930">Select this option if you want your response sent to the meeting organizers.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="931">IMAP Subscriptions Manager</p>
<p xid="932">Because IMAP folders exist on the server, and opening them or checking them takes time, you need fine-grained control over the way that you use IMAP folders. You use the IMAP subscriptions manager to do this. If you prefer to have every mail folder displayed, you can select that option as well. However, if you want to choose specific items in your mailbox, and exclude others, you can use the subscription management tool to do that.</p>
<p xid="933">Select Folder &gt; Subscriptions.</p>
<p xid="934">If you have accounts on multiple IMAP servers, select the server where you want to manage your subscriptions. </p>
<p xid="935">Evolution displays a list of available files and folders.</p>
<p xid="936">Select a file or folder by clicking it. </p>
<p xid="937">You should select at least the Inbox folder. Depending upon the way your IMAP server is configured, the list of available files might include non-mail folders. If it does, you can ignore them.</p>
<p xid="938">Click Subscribe to add a folder to the subscribed list.</p>
<p xid="939">When you have subscribed to the folders you want, close the window.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="940">Encryption</p>
<p xid="941">To protect and encode your e-mail transmissions, Evolution offers two encryption methods:</p>
<p xid="942">GPG Encryption</p>
<p xid="943">S/MIME Encryption</p>
<p xid="944">Evolution helps you protect your privacy by using GNU Privacy Guard (GPG), an implementation of strong <a xlink:href="#public-key-encryption" xid="945">Public Key Encryption.</a></p>
<p xid="947">GPG uses two keys: public and private. You can give your public key to anyone you want to receive encrypted messages, or put it on a public key server so that people can look it up before contacting you. Your private key lets you decrypt any message encrypted with your public key. Never give your private key to anyone. </p>
<p xid="948">Using encryption takes a bit of forethought. When you send a message that is encrypted, you must encrypt it using your intended recipient's public key. To receive an encrypted message, you must make sure that the sender has your public key in advance. For signing messages, you encrypt the signature with your private key, so only your public key can unlock it. When you send the message, the recipient gets your public key and unlocks the signature, verifying your identity.</p>
<p xid="949">Evolution does not support older versions of PGP, such as OpenPGP and Inline PGP.</p>
<p xid="950">You can use encryption in two different ways:</p>
<p xid="951">You can encrypt the entire message, so that nobody but the recipient can read it.</p>
<p xid="952">You can attach an encrypted signature to a plain text message, so that the recipient can read the message without decrypting it, and needs decrypting only to verify the sender's identity.</p>
<p xid="953">For example, suppose that Kevin wants to send an encrypted message to his friend Rachel. He looks up her public key on a general key server, and then tells Evolution to encrypt the message. The message now reads @#$23ui7yr87#@!48970fsd. When the information gets to Rachel, she decrypts it using her private key, and it appears as plain text for her to read.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="954">Making a GPG Encryption Key</p>
<p xid="955">Before you can get or send encrypted mail, you need to generate your public and private keys with GPG. This procedure covers version 1.2.4 of GPG. If your version is different, these steps might vary slightly. You can find out your version number by entering gpg --version.</p>
<p xid="956">Open a terminal and enter gpg --gen-key.</p>
<p xid="957">Select an algorithm, then press Enter.</p>
<p xid="958">or</p>
<p xid="959">To accept the default algorithm of DSA and ElGamal, press Enter (recommended).</p>
<p xid="960">Select a key length, then press Enter. To accept the default, 1024 bits, press Enter.</p>
<p xid="961">Enter how long your key should be valid for. </p>
<p xid="962">or</p>
<p xid="963">To accept the default of no expiration, press Enter, then press Y when you are prompted to verify the selection.</p>
<p xid="964">Type your real name, then press Enter.</p>
<p xid="965">Type your e-mail address, then press Enter.</p>
<p xid="966">(Optional) Type a comment, then press Enter.</p>
<p xid="967">Review your selected user ID. If it is correct, press O.</p>
<p xid="968">Type a passphrase, then press Enter.</p>
<p xid="969">Move your mouse randomly to generate the keys.</p>
<p xid="970">After the keys are generated, you can view your key information by entering gpg --list-keys. You should see something similar to this: /home/you/.gnupg/pubring.gpg ---------------------------- pub 1024D/32j38dk2 2001-06-20 you &lt;you@example.com&gt; sub 1024g/289sklj3 2001-06-20 [expires: 2002-11-14] </p>
<p xid="971">GPG creates one list, or keyring, for your public keys and one for your private keys. All the public keys you know are stored in the file ~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg. If you want to give other people your key, send them that file.</p>
<p xid="972">If you want, you can upload your keys to a key server.</p>
<p xid="973">Check your public key ID with gpg--list-keys. It is the string after 1024D on the line beginning with pub. In the example above, it is 32j38dk2.</p>
<p xid="974">Enter the command gpg --send-keys --keyserver wwwkeys.pgp.net 32j38dk2. Substitute your key ID for 32j38dk2. You need your password to do this.</p>
<p xid="975">Key servers store your public keys for you so that your friends can decrypt your messages. If you choose not to use a key server, you can manually send your public key, include it in your signature file, or put it on your own Web page. However, it's easier to publish a key once, and then let people download it from a central place when they want.</p>
<p xid="976">If you don't have a key to unlock or encrypt a message, you can set your encryption tool to look it up automatically. If it can't find the key, an error message appears.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="977">Getting and Using GPG Public Keys</p>
<p xid="978">To send an encrypted message, you need to use the recipient's public key in combination with your private key. Evolution handles the encryption, but you need to get the public key and add it to your keyring.</p>
<p xid="979">To get public keys from a public key server, enter the command gpg --recv-keys --keyserver wwwkeys.pgp.net keyid, substituting keyid for your recipient's ID. You need to enter your password, and the ID is automatically added to your keyring.</p>
<p xid="980">If someone sends you a public key directly, save it as a plain text file and enter the command gpg filename to add it to your keyring.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="981">Setting up GPG Encryption</p>
<p xid="982">Click Edit &gt; Preferences, then click Mail Accounts.</p>
<p xid="983">Select the account you want to use securely, then click Edit.</p>
<p xid="984">Click the Security tab.</p>
<p xid="985">Specify your key ID in the PGP/GPG Key ID field.</p>
<p xid="986">Click OK.</p>
<p xid="987">Click Close.</p>
<p xid="988">Evolution requires that you know your key ID. If you don't remember it, you can find it by typing gpg --list-keys in a console window. Your key ID is an eight-character string with random numbers and letters.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="989">Encrypting Messages</p>
<p xid="990">To encrypt a single message:</p>
<p xid="991">Open a Compose a Message window.</p>
<p xid="992">Click Security &gt; PGP Encrypt.</p>
<p xid="993">Compose your message, then click Send.</p>
<p xid="994">You can set Evolution to always sign your e-mail messages: </p>
<p xid="995">Click Edit &gt; Preferences, then select Mail Accounts.</p>
<p xid="996">Select the mail account to encrypt, then click Edit.</p>
<p xid="997">Click the Security tab.</p>
<p xid="998">Select Always Sign Outgoing Messages When Using This Account.</p>
<p xid="999">Click OK.</p>
<p xid="1000">Click Close.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1001">Unencrypting a Received Message</p>
<p xid="1002">If you receive an encrypted message, you need to decrypt it before you read it. Remember, the sender must have your public key before they can send you an encrypted message.</p>
<p xid="1003">When you view the message, Evolution prompts you for your PGP password. Enter it, and the unencrypted message is displayed. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1004">S/MIME Encryption</p>
<p xid="1005">S/MIME encryption also uses a key-based approach, but it has some significant advantages in convenience and security. S/MIME uses certificates, which are similar to keys. The public portion of each certificate is held by the sender of a message and by one of several certificate authorities, who are paid to guarantee the identity of the sender and the security of the message. Evolution already recognizes a large number of certificate authorities, so when you get a message with an S/MIME certificate, your system automatically receives the public portion of the certificate and decrypts or verifies the message.</p>
<p xid="1006">S/MIME is used most often in corporate settings. In these cases, administrators supply certificates that they have purchased from a certificate authority. In some cases, an organization can act as its own certificate authority, with or without a guarantee from a dedicated authority such as VeriSign or Thawte. In either case, the system administrator provides you with a certificate file.</p>
<p xid="1007">If you want to use S/MIME independently, you can extract an identification certificate from your Mozilla or Netscape Web browser. See the Mozilla help for more information on security certificates.</p>
<p xid="1008">The certificate file is a password-protected file on your computer.</p>
<p style="Heading 2" xid="1009">Adding a Signing Certificate</p>
<p xid="1010">Click Edit &gt; Preferences, then click Certificate.</p>
<p xid="1011">Click Import.</p>
<p xid="1012">Select the file to import, then click Open.</p>
<p xid="1013">Click Close.</p>
<p xid="1014">Similarly, you can add certificates that are sent to you independently of any authority by clicking the Contact Certificates tab and using the same Import tool. You can also add new certificate authorities, which have their own certificate files, in the same way.</p>
<p style="Heading 2" xid="1015">Signing or Encrypting Every Message</p>
<p xid="1016">After you have added your certificate, you can sign or encrypt a message by clicking Security &gt; S/MIME Sign or S/MIME Encrypt in the message composer. </p>
<p xid="1017">To have every message signed or encrypted:</p>
<p xid="1018">Click Edit &gt; Preferences, then select the account to encrypt the messages in.</p>
<p xid="1019">Click Edit, then click Security.</p>
<p xid="1020">Click Select next to Signing Certificate and specify the path to your signing certificate.</p>
<p xid="1021">or</p>

<p xid="1028">Whether you only get a few e-mail messages a day, or you receive hundreds, you probably want to sort and organize them. Evolution has the tools to help you do it.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1029">Importing Your Old E-Mail</p>
<p xid="1030">Evolution allows you to import old e-mail and contacts so that you don't need to worry about losing your old information.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1031">Importing Single Files</p>
<p xid="1032">Evolution can import the following types of files:</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1033">vCard (.vcf, .gcrd):</p>
<p xid="1034"> The address book format used by the GNOME, KDE, and many other contact management applications. You should be able to export to vCard format from any address book application. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1035">iCalendar or iCal (.ics): </p>
<p xid="1036">A format for storing calendar files. iCalendar is used by Palm OS handhelds, Evolution, and Microsoft Outlook. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1037">Evolution/Mozilla/Outlook CSV/Tab (.csv, .tab): </p>
<p xid="1038">CSV or Tab files saved using Evolution, Microsoft Outlook and Mozilla.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1039">Microsoft Outlook Express 4 (.mbx): </p>
<p xid="1040">The e-mail file format used by Microsoft Outlook Express 4. For other versions of Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express, see the workaround described in <a xlink:href="#bsawgkk" xid="1041">Step 1</a>. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1043">LDAP Data Interchange Format (.LDIF):</p>
<p xid="1044"> A standard data format for contact cards. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1045">Berkley Mailbox (.mbox or null extension): </p>
<p xid="1046">The e-mail format used by Mozilla, Netscape, Evolution, Eudora, and many other e-mail clients. </p>
<p xid="1047">To import your old e-mail: </p>
<p xid="1048">Click File &gt; Import.</p>
<p xid="1049">Click Forward.</p>
<p xid="1050">Select Import a Single File, then click Forward.</p>
<p xid="1051">Select the file to import, then click Forward.</p>
<p xid="1052">Click Import.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1053">Importing Multiple Files</p>
<p xid="1054">Evolution automates the import process for several applications it can recognize. </p>
<p xid="1055">Click File &gt; Import.</p>
<p xid="1056">Click Forward.</p>
<p xid="1057">Select Import Data and Settings From Older Programs, then click Forward.</p>
<p xid="1058">Evolution searches for old mail programs and, if possible, imports the data from them.</p>
<p xid="1059">Microsoft Outlook and versions of Outlook Express after version 4 use proprietary formats that Evolution cannot read or import. One migration method that works well is to use the Outport application. See <a xlink:href="http%3a//outport.sourceforge.net" xid="1060">outport.sourceforge.net</a> for additional information. You can also import data into another Windows mail client such as Mozilla. </p>
<p xid="1062">While in Windows, import your .pst files into Mozilla Mail (or another mail program such as Netscape or Eudora that uses the standard mbox format).</p>
<p xid="1063">Mozilla and Netscape users need to click File &gt; Compact &gt; All Folders from within the Netscape or Mozilla mail tool. Otherwise, Evolution imports and undeletes the messages in your Trash folders.</p>
<p xid="1064">Copy the files to the system or partition that Evolution is installed on.</p>
<p xid="1065">Use the Evolution import tool to import the files.</p>
<p xid="1066">For POP mail, filters are applied as messages are downloaded. For IMAP mail, filters are applied to new messages when you open the Inbox folder. On Exchange servers, filters are not applied until you select your Inbox folder and click Actions &gt; Apply Filters, or press Ctrl+Y. To force your filters to act on all messages in the folder, select the entire folder by pressing Ctrl+A, then apply the filters by pressing Ctrl+Y. </p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1067">Sorting Mail with Column Headers</p>
<p xid="1068">The message list normally has columns to indicate whether a message has been read, whether it has attachments, how important it is, and the sender, date, and subject. You can change the column order, or add and remove columns by dragging and dropping them.</p>
<p xid="1069">Right-click one of the column headers to get a list of options:</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1070">Sort Ascending: </p>
<p xid="1071">Sorts the messages top to bottom. Similarly, Sort Descending reverses the order, and Unsort removes sorting from this column, reverting to the order of messages as they were added to the folder.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1072">Removing a Column: </p>
<p xid="1073">Remove this column from the display. You can also remove columns by dragging the header off the list and letting it drop. </p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1074">Adding a Column: </p>
<p xid="1075">When you select this item, a dialog box appears, listing the possible columns. Drag the column you want into a space between existing column headers. A red arrow shows where the column will be placed.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1076">Best Fit: </p>
<p xid="1077">Automatically adjusts the widths of the columns for the most efficient use of space.</p>

<p xid="1081">To make sure you don't forget about a message, you can use the Follow Up feature.</p>
<p xid="1082">Select one or more messages.</p>
<p xid="1083">Right-click one of the messages.</p>
<p xid="1084">Click Mark for Follow Up.</p>
<p xid="1085"> A dialog box opens to allow you to set the type of flag and the due date.</p>
<p xid="1086">The flag itself is the action you want to remind yourself about. Several are provided for you, such as Call, Forward, and Reply, but you can enter your own note or action if you want. You can set a deadline for the flag as well.</p>
<p xid="1087">After you have added a flag, you can mark it as complete or remove it entirely by right-clicking the message, then click either Flag Completed or Clear Flag.</p>
<p xid="1088">When you read a flagged message, its flag status is displayed at the top, before the message headers. An overdue message might tell you Overdue: Call by April 07, 2003, 5:00 PM.</p>
<p xid="1089">Flags can help you organize your work in a number of ways. For example, you might add a Flag Status column to your message list and sort that way. Alternately, you could create a search folder that displays all your flagged messages, then clear the flags when you're done, so the search folder contains only messages with upcoming deadlines.</p>
<p xid="1090">If you prefer a simpler way to remind yourself about messages, you can mark them as Important by right-clicking the message, then click Mark Important.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1091">Getting Organized with Folders</p>
<p xid="1092">Evolution, like most other mail systems, stores mail in folders. You start out with a few mail folders, such as Inbox, Outbox, and Drafts, but you can create as many as you like. Create new folders by clicking Folder &gt; New, or by right-clicking in the folder list and selecting New Folder.</p>
<p xid="1093">When you click OK, your new folder appears in the folder view. You can then put messages in it by dragging and dropping them, or by using the Move button in the toolbar. If you want to move several messages at once, select the ones you want to move while holding down the Ctrl key, or use Shift to select a range of messages. If you create a filter with the filter assistant, you can have mail filed automatically.</p>
<p xid="1094">The Inbox folder on most IMAP servers cannot contain both subfolders and messages. When you create additional folders on your IMAP mail server, branch them from the root of the IMAP account's folder tree, not from the Inbox. If you create subfolders in your Inbox folder, you lose the ability to read messages that exist in your Inbox until you move the folders out of the way.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1095">Searching for Messages</p>
<p xid="1096">Most mail clients can search your messages for you, but Evolution does it faster than most because of its automatic search index.</p>
<p xid="1097">To start searching, type a word or phrase in the text area below the toolbar, and choose a search type:</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1098">Subject or Sender Contains: </p>
<p xid="1099">Shows messages where the search text is in the subject line. It does not search in the message body.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1100">Subject Does Not Contain: </p>
<p xid="1101">Finds messages that do not contain the search text in the subject.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1102">Sender Contains: </p>
<p xid="1103">Finds messages whose From: header contains a match for your search text.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1104">Recipients Contain: </p>
<p xid="1105">Finds messages with the search text in the To: and Cc: headers.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1106">Body Contains: </p>
<p xid="1107">Searches only in message text, not the subject lines.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1108">Body Does Not Contain: </p>
<p xid="1109">Finds every e-mail message that does not have the search text in the message body. It also show messages that have the search text in the subject line, if it is not also in the body.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1110">Body or Subject Contains: </p>
<p xid="1111">Searches message subjects and the messages themselves for the word or phrase you've specified in the search field.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1112">Message Contains: </p>
<p xid="1113">Searches the message body and all headers for the specified text.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1114">Advanced Search: </p>
<p xid="1115">Invokes the advanced search dialog box.</p>
<p xid="1116">When you've typed your search phrase, press Enter or click the Find Now button. Evolution shows your search results in the message list.</p>
<p xid="1117">For more complex search rules, select Advanced from the Search menu. You might want to create a search folder instead; see <a xlink:href="#usage-mail-organize-vfolders" xid="1118">Using Search Folders</a> for more detail.</p>
<p xid="1120">When you have finished searching, go back to seeing all your messages by clicking the Clear button, or by entering a blank search.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1121">Stopping Junk Mail (Spam)</p>
<p xid="1122">Evolution can check for junk mail for you. Evolution uses SpamAssassin with trainable Bayesian filters to perform the spam check. When the software detects mail that appears to be junk mail, it will flag it and hide it from your view. Messages that are flagged as junk mail are displayed only in the Junk folder.</p>
<p xid="1123">The junk mail filter can learn which kinds of mail are legitimate and which are not if you train it. When you first start using junk mail blocking, check the Junk folder to be sure that legitimate mail doesn't get flagged as junk mail. If good mail, is incorrectly flagged, remove it from the Junk folder by right-clicking it and selecting Mark as Not Junk. If Evolution misses junk mail, right-click the message, then click Mark as Junk. When you correct it, the filter can recognize similar messages in the future, and becomes more accurate as time goes on.</p>
<p xid="1124">To change your junk mail filtering preferences, click Edit &gt; Preferences, then click Mail Preferences. In the mail preferences tool, click the Junk tab for the following options: </p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1125">Checking Incoming Mail for Junk: </p>
<p xid="1126">This option turns automatic junk mail filtering on or off.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1127">Include Remote Tests: </p>
<p xid="1128">This option uses tests that require a network connection, such as checking to see if a message is in a list of known junk messages, or if the sender or gateway are blacklisted by anti-spam organizations. Remote tests add to the amount of time it takes to check for junk mail, but increase accuracy. When you select this option, you do not need to do any additional setup to make this work.</p>
<p xid="1129">For additional junk mail settings, see <a xlink:href="#more-mail-options" xid="1130">Receiving Mail Options</a>.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1132">Create Rules to Automatically Organize Mail</p>
<p xid="1133">Filters work very much like the mail room in a large company. Their purpose is to bundle, sort, and distribute mail to the various folders. In addition, you can have multiple filters performing multiple actions that might effect the same message in several ways. For example, your filters could put copies of one message into multiple folders, or keep one copy and send one to another person.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1134">Creating New Filter Rules</p>
<p xid="1135">Click Edit &gt; Message Filters.</p>
<p xid="1136">Click Add.</p>
<p xid="1137">Type a name for the filter in the Rule name field.</p>
<p xid="1138">Define the criteria for the filter in the If section.</p>
<p xid="1139">For each of the filter criteria, you must first select which parts of the message you want to filter:</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1140">Sender: </p>
<p xid="1141">The sender's address.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1142">Recipient: </p>
<p xid="1143">The recipients of the message.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1144">Subject:</p>
<p xid="1145"> The subject line of the message.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1146">Specific Header: </p>
<p xid="1147">Any header including custom ones.</p>
<p xid="1148">If a message uses a header more than once, Evolution pays attention only to the first instance, even if the message defines the header differently the second time. For example, if a message declares the Resent-From: header as engineering@example.com and then restates it as marketing@example.com, Evolution filters as though the second declaration did not occur. To filter on messages that use headers multiple times, use a regular expression. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1149">Message Body: </p>
<p xid="1150">Searches in the actual text of the message.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1151">Expression:</p>
<p xid="1152"> (For programmers only) Match a message according to an expression you write in the Scheme language, used to define filters in Evolution.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1153">Date Sent: </p>
<p xid="1154">Filters messages according to the date on which they were sent. First, choose the conditions you want a message to meet, such as before a given time or after a given time. Then choose the time. The filter compares the message's time stamp to the system clock when the filter is run, or to a specific time and date you choose from a calendar. You can also have it look for a message within a range of time relative to the filter, such as two to four days ago.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1155">Date Received: </p>
<p xid="1156">This works the same way as the Date Sent option, except that it compares the time you received the message with the dates you specify.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1157">Label: </p>
<p xid="1158">Messages can have labels of Important, Work, Personal, To Do, or Later. You can set tables with other filters or by hand.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1159">Score: </p>
<p xid="1160">Sets the message score to any whole number greater than 0. You can have one filter set or change a message score, and then set up another filter to move the messages you have scored. A message score is not based on anything in particular: it is simply a number you can assign to messages so other filters can process them.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1161">Size: </p>
<p xid="1162">Sorts based on the size of the message in kilobytes.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1163">Status: </p>
<p xid="1164">Filters according to the status of a message. The status can be Replied To, Draft, Important, Read, or Junk.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1165">Flagged: </p>
<p xid="1166">Checks whether the message is flagged for follow-up.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1167">Attachments: </p>
<p xid="1168">Creates a filter based on whether there is an attachment for the e-mail.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1169">Mailing List: </p>
<p xid="1170">Filters based on the mailing list the message came from. This filter might miss messages from some list servers, because it checks for the X-BeenThere header, which is used to identify mailing lists or other redistributors of mail. Mail from list servers that do not set X-BeenThere properly are not be caught by these filters.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1171">Regex Match: </p>
<p xid="1172">If you know your way around a <a xlink:href="#regular-expression" xid="1173">regex</a>, or regular expression, this option allows you to search for complex patterns of letters, so that you can find, for example, all words that start with a and end with m, and are between six and fifteen letters long, or all messages that declare a particular header twice. For information about how to use regular expressions, check the man page for the grep command.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1175">Source Account: </p>
<p xid="1176">Filters messages according the server you got them from. This is most useful if you use multiple POP mail accounts.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1177">Pipe to Program: </p>
<p xid="1178">Evolution can use an external command to process a message, then process it based on the return value. Commands used in this way must return an integer. This is most commonly used to add an external junk mail filter.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1179">Junk Test: </p>
<p xid="1180">Filters based on the results of the junk mail test.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1181">Select the Criteria for the Condition: </p>
<p xid="1182">If you want multiple criteria for this filter, click Add Criterion and repeat step 4.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1183">Select the Actions for the Filter in the Then Section: </p>
<p xid="1184">Select any of the following options.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1185">Move to Folder: </p>
<p xid="1186">Moves the message into a folder you specify. Click Here to select the destination folder.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1187">Copy to Folder: </p>
<p xid="1188">Puts a copy of the message into a folder you specify. Click Here to select the destination folder.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1189">Delete: </p>
<p xid="1190">Marks the message for deletion. The message can be undeleted until you expunge or empty the trash.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1191">Stop Processing: </p>
<p xid="1192">Select this if you want to have all other filters ignore this message.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1193">Assign Color: </p>
<p xid="1194">Marks the message with a color of your choice.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1195">Assign Score: </p>
<p xid="1196">Assigns the message a numeric score.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1197">Adjust Score: </p>
<p xid="1198">Changes the numeric score by the amount you set.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1199">Set Status: </p>
<p xid="1200">Sets the status of the message. The status can be Replied To, Draft, Important, Read, or Junk.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1201">Unset Status: </p>
<p xid="1202">If the message has a status value, unsets it. If a status value is not set, it does nothing.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1203">Beep: </p>
<p xid="1204">Makes the system beep.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1205">Play Sound: </p>
<p xid="1206">Select a sound file for Evolution to play.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1207">Pipe to Program: </p>
<p xid="1208">Sends the message to a program of your choice. No return value is expected. This feature can be used to create automatic Web postings from e-mail messages or to perform additional message post processing not supported by Evolution.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1209">Run Program: </p>
<p xid="1210">Evolution runs an application.</p>
<p xid="1211">Click Add Action if you need multiple actions.</p>
<p xid="1212">Click OK twice.</p>
<p xid="1213">There is an easy shortcut for fast filter or search folder creation:</p>
<p xid="1214">Right-click the message in the e-mail list.</p>
<p xid="1215">Select one of the items under the Create Rule from the Message submenu.</p>
<p xid="1216">Creating a rule based on a message opens the filter creation tool with some of the information about the message already filled in for your convenience.</p>
<p xid="1217"></p>
<p xid="1218">If you have several filters that match a single message, they are all applied to the message in order, unless one of the filters has the Stop Processing action. If you use that action in a filter, the messages that it affects are not touched by other filters. </p>
<p xid="1219">When you first open the Filters dialog box, you are shown the list of filters sorted in the order in which they will be applied. You can move them up and down in the priority list by clicking the Up and Down buttons. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1220">Editing Filters</p>
<p xid="1221">Click Edit &gt; Message Filters.</p>
<p xid="1222">Select the filter to edit, then click Edit.</p>

<p xid="1225">Click Edit &gt; Message Filters.</p>
<p xid="1226">Select the filter to remove, then click Remove. </p>
<p xid="1227">Click OK.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1228">Using Search Folders</p>
<p xid="1229">If filters aren't flexible enough, or you find yourself performing the same search again and again, consider a search folder. Search folders are an advanced way of viewing your e-mail messages within Evolution. If you get a lot of mail or often forget where you put messages, search folders can help you keep things organized.</p>
<p xid="1230">A search folder is really a hybrid of all the other organizational tools: it looks like a folder, it acts like a search, and you set it up like a filter. In other words, a conventional folder actually contains messages, but a search folder is a view of messages that might be in several different folders. The messages it contains are determined on the fly using a set of criteria you choose in advance.</p>
<p xid="1231">As messages that meet the search folder criteria arrive or are deleted, Evolution automatically adjusts the search folder contents. When you delete a message, it is erased from the folder in which it actually exists, as well as any search folders that display it.</p>
<p xid="1232">The Unmatched Search Folder is the opposite of other search folders: it displays all messages that do not appear in other search folders.</p>
<p xid="1233">If you use remote e-mail storage like IMAP or Microsoft Exchange, and have created search folders to search through them, the Unmatched Search Folder also searches the remote folders. If you do not create any search folders that search remote mail stores, the Unmatched Search Folder does not search in them either.</p>
<p xid="1234">As an example of using folders, searches, and search folders, consider the following: To organize his mailbox, Jim sets up a virtual folder for e-mail from his friend and co-worker Anna. He has another search folder for messages that have novell.com in the address and Evolution in the subject line, so he can keep a record of what people from work send him about Evolution. If Anna sends him a message about anything other than Evolution, it only shows up in the Anna search folder. When Anna sends him mail about the user interface for Evolution, he can see the message both in the Anna search folder and in the Internal Evolution Discussion search folder. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1235">Creating A Search Folder</p>
<p xid="1236">Click Message &gt; Create Rule, then select a search folder based on Subject, Sender, Recipient, or Mailing List.</p>
<p xid="1237">or</p>
<p xid="1238">Click Search &gt; Create Search Folder From Search.</p>
<p xid="1239">Click Add.</p>
<p xid="1240"></p>
<p xid="1241">Type the name of the search folder in the Rule Name field.</p>
<p xid="1242">Select your search criteria. For each criterion, you must first select which of the following parts of the message you want the search to examine. The criteria are similar to those for filters.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1243">Sender: </p>
<p xid="1244">Sender's address.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1245">Recipients: </p>
<p xid="1246">The recipients of the message.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1247">Subject: </p>

<p style="Section Heading" xid="1302">Contacts and Cards</p>
<p xid="1303">Contacts are the individuals you have chosen to add to your address book so you can keep track of information about them and send e-mail to them. In Evolution, an individual contact is called a card.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1304">The Contact Editor</p>
<p xid="1305">If you want to add or change cards, you use the contact editor. To change a card that already exists, double-click it to open the contact editor window. If you want to create a new card, click the New button in the toolbar to open the same window, with blank entry boxes for you to fill in.</p>
<p xid="1306"></p>
<p xid="1307">The contact editor window has three tabs:</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1308">Contact: </p>
<p xid="1309">Contains basic contact information.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1310">Personal: </p>
<p xid="1311">Contains a more specific description of the person, including URLs for calendar and free/busy information.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1312">Mailing Address: </p>
<p xid="1313">Contains the individual's mailing address. </p>
<p xid="1314">You can also use Actions menu to find Forward Contact, which opens a new message with the card already attached, and Send Message to Contact, which opens a new message to the contact's e-mail address.</p>
<p xid="1315">From the Contact Editor toolbar, you can save and close, print, close, or delete the contact.</p>
<p xid="1316">You can add cards from within an e-mail message or calendar appointment. In an open e-mail, right-click any e-mail address or message, and click Create Card for this Address or Create Card for this Sender from the menu.</p>
<p xid="1317">Most of the items in the contact editor simply display the information you enter, but some of them have additional features:</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1318">Full Name: </p>
<p xid="1319">Specify the name of your contact here. You can type a name into the Full Name field, but you can also click the Full Name button to bring up a small dialog box with text boxes for first and last names, titles like Mr. or Her Excellency, and suffixes like Jr. The Full Name field also interacts with the File Under box to help you organize your contacts and to handle multi-word surnames.To see how it works, type a name in the Full Name field. As an example, we'll use Miguel de Icaza. You'll notice that the File Under field also fills in, but in reverse: Icaza, Miguel de. If you had entered John Q. Doe, the contacts editor would have correctly guessed that the entry should be filed under Doe, John Q. However, Miguel's surname, de Icaza, has two words, and to sort it correctly you must enter de Icaza, Miguel in the File As entry.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1320">Where: </p>
<p xid="1321">Select one of your address books as the location for this contact. You might not be able to write to all available address books, especially those on a network.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1322">Categories: </p>
<p xid="1323">Click the Categories button to select categories for this card. If you assign contact categories, you can then search for contacts using those categories. For more information on contact categories, see <a xlink:href="#usage-contact-organize" xid="1324">Organizing your Contacts</a>.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1326">Free/Busy and Calendar URLs: </p>
<p xid="1327">Click the Personal Information tab to enter Web addresses for the contact. If the contact publishes Free/Busy or calendar data online, using a server other than Exchange or GroupWise, you can specify the addresses for those servers here. After you do so, you can check their schedules when creating appointments in the calendar.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1328">Searching for Contacts</p>
<p xid="1329">Select your search type in the search bar.</p>
<p xid="1330">Specify your query.</p>
<p xid="1331">Press Enter to begin the search.</p>
<p xid="1332">For a more complex search, select Search Advanced and select criteria that describe your desired contact:</p>
<p xid="1333">Name the rule in the Rule Name field.</p>
<p xid="1334">Set up your criteria in the If field.</p>
<p xid="1335">Click Add Criterion to add additional criteria.</p>
<p xid="1336">Click Search.</p>
<p xid="1337">To show all your contacts, Click Clear in the search bar, press Shift+Ctrl+B, or search with an empty query.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1338">Organizing your Contacts</p>
<p xid="1339">Just as you can search mail, you can search contacts. You can also create several individual address books, or contact groups. Within a given contact group, you can have several categories of contacts. </p>
<p xid="1340"><a xlink:href="#usage-contact-organize-group" xid="1341">Contacts Groups</a></p>

<p style="Heading 1" xid="1355">Contacts Groups</p>
<p xid="1356">The simplest way to organize contacts is to create additional address books. You can create a new one by clicking File &gt; New &gt; Address Book. For contacts groups on your computer, you only need to provide a name. For contacts on the network, you need to provide more information about the contacts server you are trying to access. </p>
<p xid="1357">To move a card from one group to another, just drag it from the main display of contacts. You cannot change the contents of most network contact groups. </p>
<p xid="1358">Contacts groups are not the same as contact lists. A contacts group is like a folder or address book full of contacts. A contact list is a single contact that contains other contacts, and is most often used to e-mail several people at once.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1359">Importing Contacts</p>
<p xid="1360">You can import contacts from other contact management tools with the Import tool.</p>
<p xid="1361">Click File &gt; Import.</p>
<p xid="1362">or</p>
<p xid="1363">Mail yourself a contact as vCard attachment. </p>
<p xid="1364">Currently VCF and LDIF are supported. CSV and TAB format files are supported from Microsoft Outlook, Thunderbird, Mozilla, and Evolution.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1365">Creating a List of Contacts</p>
<p xid="1366">A contact list is a set of contacts with a single nickname that you create. When you send e-mail to the nickname, it is sent to every member of the list. This differs from a network mailing list in that it exists only on your computer as a convenience to you, rather than as an actual e-mail address managed by a mailing list application on a server.</p>
<p xid="1367">For example, you could create one card for each family member, then add those cards to a contact list called Family. Then, instead of entering each person's e-mail address individually, you can send e-mail to Family and the message would go to all of them.</p>
<p xid="1368"> To create a list of contacts: </p>
<p xid="1369">Open the list creation dialog box by clicking the New List button.</p>
<p xid="1370">or</p>
<p xid="1371">Click File &gt; New &gt; Contact List.</p>
<p xid="1372">Specify a name for the list.</p>
<p xid="1373">Specify the names or e-mail addresses of contacts.</p>
<p xid="1374">or</p>
<p xid="1375">Drag contacts from the main window into the list.</p>
<p xid="1376">Choose whether you want to hide the e-mail addresses when you send a message to the list. </p>
<p xid="1377">Unless it is a very small list, it is recommended that you leave the addresses hidden. This is the same thing as using the Bcc: feature discussed in <a xlink:href="#usage-mail-getnsend-send-to-types" xid="1378">Specifying Additional Recipients for E-Mail</a>.</p>
<p xid="1380">When you are finished, click OK. </p>
<p xid="1381">The list appears as a contact card, which you can use as you would any other card, including e-mailing the list to another person and sending e-mail to the list.</p>
<p xid="1382">To mail the list, open a new e-mail and type the name you chose for the list. Evolution addresses the message to the entire list when you send the message. You can also right-click the list's address card in the contacts tool and select Send Message to List.</p>
<p xid="1383">Evolution cannot store contact lists on Microsoft Exchange servers.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1384">Grouping with Categories</p>
<p xid="1385">Anther way to group cards is to mark them as belonging to different categories. You can mark a card as being in several categories or no category at all. For example, you put a friend's card in the Business category because he works with you, the Friends category because he's a friend, and the Frequent category because you call him often.</p>
<p xid="1386">To mark a card as belonging to a category, click the Categories button at the lower right. In the dialog box that appears, you can select as many or as few categories as you like.</p>
<p xid="1387">If the master list of categories doesn't suit you, you can add your own categories. Just specify the new category's name in the dialog box, then click Categories and select Edit Master Category List in the window that appears. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1388">Selecting Your Default Contact List</p>
<p xid="1389">You can select one of your contact lists as your default contact list. To select your default contact list, right-click the contact list to be your default contact list, then click default. All new contacts are then added to your default contact list or to your selected contact list. </p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1390">LDAP: Shared Contact Groups on a Network</p>
<p xid="1391">The <a xlink:href="#ldap" xid="1392">LDAP</a> protocol was created to let users share contact information over a network by sharing access to a central directory. LDAP allows a company to maintain a shared set of contact information. Many companies keep a common LDAP address book for all their employees or for client contacts.</p>
<p xid="1394">To learn how to add a remote LDAP directory to your available contact folders, see <a xlink:href="#config-prefs-contact" xid="1395">Contact Management</a>. Remote groups of contacts appear under the On LDAP Servers item in the shortcut bar. They work like a local folder of contact cards, with the following exceptions: </p>
<p xid="1397">Network folders are only available when you are connected to the network. If you use a laptop or have a modem connection, you might want to copy or cache some of the network directory. You do this by dragging and dropping your desired contacts into the local contacts list.</p>
<p xid="1398">You can also mark the network folder for offline usage. To mark the folder, right-click the folder, then click Properties. Select Copy Folder Content Locally for Offline Operation.</p>
<p xid="1399">To prevent excess network traffic, Evolution does not normally load data from the LDAP server upon opening. </p>
<p xid="1400">Depending on your server settings, you might not be able to edit all the fields in a contact stored on an LDAP server. Some servers prohibit some or all changes, and others use a smaller set of fields than Evolution allows. Check with your system administrator if you need different settings.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1401">Configuring Evolution to use LDAP</p>
<p xid="1402">For information about setting up Evolution to use LDAP, refer to <a xlink:href="#config-prefs-contact" xid="1403">Contact Management</a>.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1405">Send Me a Card: Adding New Cards Quickly</p>
<p xid="1406">When you get information about a person in the mail or in a calendar entry, you can add it to an address card. To do so, right-click any e-mail address or e-mail message, and click Add Sender to Contacts on the menu that appears. If the sender already exists, the Editor tab opens and you can edit the detail. Evolution can also add cards from a hand-held device during HotSync operation. For more information, see <a xlink:href="#config-sync" xid="1407">Synchronizing Your Handheld Device</a>.</p>

<p style="Section Heading" xid="1444">Ways of Looking at your Calendar</p>
<p xid="1445">In Evolution, you can keep multiple calendars and overlay them one over the next. For example, you might have a schedule of events for work, one for home, and one for your favorite sports team. The shortcut bar lists those calendars, and you can select or deselect the boxes next to them to show and hide the appointments in your calendar view. By hiding and showing different sets of appointments, you can be sure to avoid conflicts, while keeping a minimum of clutter in your view.</p>
<p xid="1446">Appointments for each calendar appear as a different color.</p>
<p xid="1447">The toolbar offers you five different buttons that can show you different views of your calendar: </p>
<p xid="1448">Day </p>
<p xid="1449">Work Week </p>
<p xid="1450">Week </p>
<p xid="1451">Month</p>
<p xid="1452">List</p>
<p xid="1453">You can also select an arbitrary range of days in the small calendar at the upper right. To do this, click and drag on the days that you want to view in your calendar.</p>
<p xid="1454">The Prev and Next buttons move you forward and back in your calendar pages. If you are using a week or month view, you can move by week or month. To return to today's listing, click the Today button in the toolbar.</p>
<p xid="1455">To visit calendar entries for a specific date, click Go To and select the date in the dialog box that appears.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1456">Scheduling With the Evolution Calendar</p>
<p xid="1457">There are two types of events you can schedule with Evolution: appointments and meetings. An appointment is an event you schedule for yourself only, and a meeting is an event that you schedule multiple people for. You can also use the busy/free search for meetings to determine the availability of invitees.</p>

<p xid="1529">Click Options &gt; Recurrence, and specify whether you want the appointment to recur and how often.</p>
<p xid="1530">An All Day event appears at the top of a day's appointment list, in the grey header under the date, rather than inside. That makes it easy to have appointments that overlap and fit inside each other. For example, a conference might be an All Day appointment, and the meetings at the conference could be timed appointments. Appointments with specific starting and ending times can also overlap. When they do they display as multiple columns in the day view of the calendar.</p>
<p xid="1531">If you create calendar appointments that overlap, Evolution displays them side by side in your calendar. </p>
<p style="Heading 2" xid="1532">Reminders</p>
<p xid="1533">You can have several Reminders for individual appointments, any time prior to the appointment you schedule. You can have one reminder of each of the following types: </p>
<p style="Heading 2" xid="1534">Display: </p>
<p xid="1535">A notification pops up on your screen to remind you of your appointment. </p>
<p style="Heading 2" xid="1536">Audio: </p>
<p xid="1537">Your computer delivers a sound alarm. </p>
<p style="Heading 2" xid="1538">Program: </p>
<p xid="1539">You can run a program as a reminder. You can enter its name in the text field, or find it with the Browse button. </p>
<p xid="1540">Apart from the above notifications, the Evolution alarm icon blink in the notification area. To pause the alarm or view the event, click the notification icon.</p>
<p xid="1541">To create a reminder:</p>
<p xid="1542">When creating an appointment, click Alarms on the toolbar, or click Options &gt; Alarms.</p>
<p xid="1543">Select the alarm for the event.</p>
<p xid="1544">Select Customize to add or remove customized alarms for the event.</p>
<p xid="1545">If you have stored reminders in a local calendar, they work from the moment you log in. However, for reminders stored on an Exchange server, you must run Evolution at least once after logging in. No matter where the reminders are stored, you can quit Evolution and still be reminded of an upcoming appointment. </p>
<p style="Heading 2" xid="1546">Classifications</p>
<p xid="1547">If you are using a calendar on a Novell GroupWise or Microsoft Exchange server, select a classification for the appointment to determine who can view it. Public is the default category, and a public appointment can be viewed by anyone on the calendar-sharing network. Private denotes one level of security, and Confidential an even higher level. The different levels vary depending on your server settings; check with your system administrator or adjust your delegation settings.</p>
<p xid="1548">If you are using a Novell GroupWise or Microsoft Exchange server, other people on the server can check your schedule to see if you are available at any given time. If you have an appointment that is flexible or that you want to designate as Free rather than Busy time, select the Free box in the Show Time As section. Normally, appointments display as Busy. </p>
<p xid="1549">You can categorize appointments in the same way you can categorize contacts. </p>
<p xid="1550">Type a category in the Categories field. </p>
<p xid="1551">Select the check box next to each category that matches the appointment you are creating.</p>
<p xid="1552">To show or hide Categories field, click View &gt; Categories.</p>

<p xid="1554">After you've selected your categories, click OK to assign these categories to the appointment. The categories you selected are now listed in the text box to the right of the Categories button.</p>
<p xid="1555">Appointments with categories appear with icons in the calendar display, and you can also search for appointments by category. To display only the appointments in a particular category, select Category Is in the search bar at the top of the calendar, and select a category.</p>
<p style="Heading 2" xid="1556">Recurrence</p>
<p xid="1557">The Recurrence tool button lets you describe repetition in appointments ranging from once every day up to once every 100 years. You can then choose a time and date when the appointment stops recurring, and, under Exceptions, pick individual days when the appointment does not recur. Make your selections from left to right, and you form a sentence: Every two weeks on Monday and Friday until January 3, 2008 or Every month on the first Friday for 12 occurrences.</p>
<p xid="1558">After you have finished settings, click the disk icon in the toolbar to save and close the appointment editor window. If you want, you can alter an appointment summary in the calendar view by clicking it and typing. You can change other settings by right-clicking the appointment then choosing Open, or double-clicking the appointment.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1559">Sending a Meeting Invitation</p>
<p xid="1560">In Evolution, a meeting is an event you schedule for multiple people. Evolution can be used to schedule group meetings and help you manage responses to meeting requests.</p>
<p xid="1561">When you create a meeting or group appointment, you can specify the attendees in several categories, such as chair or required. When you save the meeting listing, each attendee is sent an e-mail with the meeting information, which also gives them the option to respond.</p>
<p xid="1562">If you don't need to collect attendance information when you're scheduling an event, and would rather just announce the event, right-click the meeting and select Forward as iCalendar. This opens a new e-mail message with the event notification attached as an announcement. Recipients can add the event to their calendars with one click, but it won't automatically send you e-mail about whether they plan to attend.</p>
<p xid="1563">To schedule a meeting: </p>

<p xid="1596">An e-mail is sent out to all the recipients, inviting them to your event.</p>
<p xid="1597">A meeting can have only one organizer, and only the organizer can add participants. You can designate yourself the organizer of the meeting, but if you are not the original organizer, you can create confusion in the scheduling process. If you want to invite additional people to a meeting without changing the organizer, it's best to forward the first organizer's message to the additional participants.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="1598"> Accepting and Replying to a Meeting Request</p>
<p xid="1599">Meeting requests are sent as iCal attachments. To view or respond to one, click the attachment icon and view it inline in the mail window. All the details are shown about the event, including time and dates. Then you can choose how to reply to the invitation. Your choices are:</p>

<p style="Heading 1" xid="1607">Using the Free/Busy View</p>
<p xid="1608">In addition to the standard meeting scheduling tools, you can use the Free/Busy view to check whether people are available in advance. The Free/Busy feature is normally a function of dedicated groupware servers such as Microsoft Exchange and Novell Groupwise. However, you can also publish Free/Busy information online, and access Free/Busy information published elsewhere. If not everyone you collaborate with publishes Free/Busy data, you can still use iCal event invitations to coordinate schedules with other people.</p>

<p style="Heading 2" xid="1619">Publishing Calendar and Free/Busy Information Without a Groupware Server</p>
<p xid="1620">You can publish Calendar and Free/Busy information to a WebDAV, FTP server, or remote machine through secure shell or other Web server with HTTP PUT support. Check with your system administrator if you are not sure you have this functionality.</p>

<p xid="1651">To create a new calendar, click File &gt; New &gt; Calendar. If the calendar is one you plan to store locally, you need only provide a name and color. If it is a remote calendar, specify the name, color, URL, and a refresh frequency. The refresh frequency determines how often Evolution checks to see if the calendar has changed. If you are working with someone who publishes an online calendar, you might want to check for updates every thirty minutes. On the other hand, if you have displayed a sports team schedule in your calendar, you might not need to refresh it more than once a week.</p>
<p xid="1652">The <a xlink:href="http%3a//icalshare.com" xid="1653">icalshare.com Web site</a> has an extensive list of shared online calendars, including national and religious holidays, phases of the moon, sports, and local and regional events.</p>
<p xid="1655">Evolution 2.6 lets you view and manage calendars on remote CalDAV servers such as Hula. For more information about Hula, see the <a xlink:href="http%3a//www.hula-project.org" xid="1656">Hula Project Web site</a>. The procedure to create a CalDAV calendar source is similar to that of a remote Web calendar source. You can view and create calendar events on CalDav accounts just like other calendars on Evolution.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="1658">The Task List</p>
<p xid="1659">The Task List, located in the lower-right corner of the calendar, lets you keep a list of tasks separate from your calendar appointments. You can use the list in a larger window by clicking the Tasks button in the shortcut bar or in the folder tree.</p>
<p xid="1660">Task Lists are more easily organized in the dedicated Tasks tool. Each task list is assigned a color, and you can use the Tasks tool shortcut bar to hide and show task lists just like calendars. In the calendar display task pad, tasks from all visible task lists appear, color coded by list. </p>

You can also carry out any folder-related operations for calendars, tasks, and contact folders, including adding, deleting, and renaming folders, and selecting folder permissions. Use the regular Mail tool for mail, the Contacts tool for contacts, and the Calendar tool for your schedule.</p>
<p xid="1846">If you are using both an Exchange account and a local mail account, you should be aware that whenever you save an e-mail address or appointment from an e-mail message, it is saved in your Exchange contacts list or calendar, rather than in your local account. The same is true of synchronization with Palm OS devices; tasks, appointments, and addresses from your Palm OS device are synchronized in the Exchange folders rather than local folders. </p>
<p xid="1847">To avoid unnecessary strain on the server, the Global Address List (GAL) appears empty until you have searched for something in it.</p>

<p style="Section Heading" xid="1948">GroupWise Features</p>
<p xid="1949">Evolution connecting to GroupWise supports the following basic Novell GroupWise features: </p>
<p xid="1950">Mail </p>
<p xid="1951">Viewing mail and folders stored on the GroupWise system.</p>
<p xid="1952">Sending mail from you GroupWise account.</p>
<p xid="1953">Converting mail to a task or meeting.</p>
<p xid="1954">Tracking the status of a message.</p>
<p xid="1955">Marking a message as junk mail adds the sender to your GroupWise junk mail list. </p>
<p xid="1956">Calendar </p>
<p xid="1957">You can send and receive appointment and meeting requests. Allows Evolution users to schedule meetings and view attendee availability for other users on GroupWise.</p>
<p xid="1958">You can receive an iCalendar meeting request and add it to your GroupWise calendar.</p>
<p xid="1959">Contacts </p>
<p xid="1960">Address Completion is supported for your GroupWise address books, including the corporate address book, the Frequent Contacts address book, and your personal address book.</p>
<p xid="1961">If you receive a vCard attachment and click Save in Address Book, it is saved to your Personal address book. New Address Book entries can also be added to your personal address book from received e-mail messages.</p>
<p xid="1962">The GroupWise Personal Address book and Frequent Contacts address book are created when you access your GroupWise account through the GroupWise client; they are not created when accessing your GroupWise account with Evolution. The GroupWise system address book is marked for offline use by default. This helps with performance.</p>
<p xid="1963">Proxy</p>
<p xid="1964">You can assign Proxy access to other users.</p>
<p xid="1965">You can view other users' accounts through Proxy access.</p>
<p xid="1966">There are, however, some features that are not available:</p>
<p xid="1967">Resending items</p>
<p xid="1968">Retracting items</p>
<p xid="1969">Accepting appointments or meetings in offline mode</p>

<p xid="2145">Two steps must be completed before you can act as someone's proxy. First, the person for whom you plan to act as proxy must grant you rights in the Proxy List in Preferences. Second, you must proxy to the user so you can access his or her Mailbox or Calendar.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="2146">Assigning Proxy Rights to Another User</p>
<p xid="2147">Use the Proxy List in the Preferences Account Editor to give other users rights to proxy for you. You can assign each user different rights to your calendaring and messaging information. If you want to let users view specific information about your appointments when they do a Busy Search on your Calendar, give them Read access for appointments. The following table describes the rights you can grant to users:</p>

<p xid="2291">You reach the Evolution settings window by clicking Edit &gt; Preferences. In the left part of the settings window is a column, similar to the Evolution shortcut bar, that lets you choose which portion of Evolution to customize. The right part of the window is where you make your actual changes.</p>
<p xid="2292"></p>
<p xid="2293">There are six items you can customize.</p>
<p xid="2294"><c style="Heading 1">Mail Accounts</c></p>
<p xid="2295">Add or change information about your e-mail accounts, such as the servers you connect to, the way you download mail, and your password authentication mode. This is the most complex item in the list, and is covered in <a xlink:href="#config-prefs-mail-identity" xid="2296">Working with Mail Accounts</a>.</p>
<p xid="2298"><c style="Heading 1">Autocompletion</c></p>
<p xid="2299">Set the contact groups to be used when completing e-mail addresses in the message composer. For more information, see <a xlink:href="#bshoq5l" xid="2300">Autocompletion</a>.</p>
<p xid="2302"><c style="Heading 1">Mail Preferences</c></p>
<p xid="2303">These are overall mail reading preferences, such as display settings, notification options, and security. Settings that vary per account are in the Mail Accounts tool, described in <a xlink:href="#config-prefs-mail-identity" xid="2304">Working with Mail Accounts</a>, but most of the mail settings are in <a xlink:href="#config-prefs-mail" xid="2306">Mail Preferences</a>.</p>
<p xid="2308"><c style="Heading 1">Composer Preferences</c></p>
<p xid="2309">These are settings for the way that you use the mail composer, such as shortcuts, signatures, and spelling. This includes the ability to substitute graphical smiley faces for emoticons such as : ) that many people use in e-mail. This tool is covered in <a xlink:href="#config-prefs-mail-composer" xid="2310">Composer Preferences</a>.</p>
<p xid="2312"><c style="Heading 1">Calendar and Tasks</c></p>
<p xid="2313">Use these settings to control how the calendar behaves, including your time zone and the length of your work week. For more information, see <a xlink:href="#config-prefs-cal" xid="2314">Calendar and Tasks Settings</a>. </p>
<p xid="2316"><c style="Heading 1">Certificates</c></p>
<p xid="2317">Use these settings for certificate handling for S/MIME security systems. For more information, see <a xlink:href="#bshoty0" xid="2318">Certificates</a>.</p>
<p xid="2320">Previous versions of Evolution included directory servers, folder settings, and Exchange delegation in the settings tool. Directory servers can now be set up as contacts groups in the Contacts tool, you can change folder settings in the folder right-click menu, and Exchange delegation is available in the Actions menu of the Exchange tool. </p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="2321">Working with Mail Accounts</p>
<p xid="2322">Evolution allows you to maintain multiple accounts, or identities. When you are writing an e-mail message, you can choose which account to use by selecting from the drop-down list next to the From field in the message composer. </p>
<p xid="2323">Click Send/Receive to select all mail sources that are not disabled. If you don't want to check mail for a given account, select the account in the Mail Accounts tab and click the Disable button. </p>
<p xid="2324">To add a new account, click Add to open the mail configuration assistant. To alter an existing account, select it in the Preferences window, then click Edit to open the account editor dialog box.</p>
<p xid="2325">The account editor dialog box has seven sections:</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="2326">Identity: </p>
<p xid="2327">Specify the name and e-mail address for this account. You can also choose a default signature to insert into messages sent from this account.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="2328">Receiving Email: </p>
<p xid="2329">Select the way you receive e-mail. You can download e-mail from a server (<a xlink:href="#pop" xid="2330">POP</a>), read and keep it on the server (Microsoft Exchange, Novell GroupWise, or <a xlink:href="#imap" xid="2332">IMAP</a>), or read it from files that already exist on your desktop computer. Your server requires you to use a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) connection. You can select Always, Whenever Possible, or Never as your SSL choice. If one doesn't work, try another.</p>
<p xid="2334">Your system administrator might ask you to connect to a specific port on a mail server. To specify which port you use, just type a colon and the port number after the server name. For example, to connect to port 143 on the server smtp.example.com, specify smtp.example.com:143 as the server name.</p>
<p xid="2335">For additional information, see <a xlink:href="#second-step" xid="2336">Receiving Mail</a>.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="2338">Receive Options: </p>

<p style="Section Heading" xid="2343">Sending Mail: </p>
<p xid="2344">Use this section to choose and configure a method for sending mail. You can choose <a xlink:href="#smtp" xid="2345">SMTP</a>, Microsoft Exchange (if you have installed the Evolution Connector for Microsoft Exchange), or <a xlink:href="#sendmail" xid="2347">Sendmail</a>.</p>
<p xid="2349">For additional information, see <a xlink:href="#third-step" xid="2350">Sending Mail</a>.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="2352">Defaults: </p>
<p xid="2353">Use this section to set where this account stores the messages that it has sent, and the messages that you save as drafts. If you want to revert to the default settings, click Restore Defaults.</p>
<p xid="2354">If you want to send someone a copy of every message from this account, select either Always Carbon-Copy (Cc) To: or Always Blind Carbon-Copy (Bcc) To:, and specify one or more addresses.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="2355">Security: </p>
<p xid="2356">Use this section to set the security options for this account. If you use encryption, enter your PGP key ID (see <a xlink:href="#encryption" xid="2357">Encryption</a> for more information) and select among the four options to determine key and signature handling.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="2359">Proxy: </p>
<p xid="2360">This only displays if you have a GroupWise or Exchange account. Use this section to set proxy access for other users to access your mailbox or calendar.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="2361">Autocompletion</p>
<p xid="2362">The Autocompletion tool lets you choose address books to auto-complete names for you. This functionality requires accessibility to each of the address books you want to use. To enable autocompletion, select each of the address books that you want to use auto completion in the Autocompletion page.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="2363">Mail Preferences</p>
<p xid="2364">The Mail Preferences tool lets you choose how to display citations, how long to wait before marking a message as read, and other mail display settings. </p>

<p style="Heading 1" xid="2389">General Mail Settings</p>
<p xid="2390">The General page has the following options:</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="2391">Message Fonts: </p>
<p xid="2392">Normally, Evolution uses the same fonts as other GNOME applications. To choose different fonts, deselect Use the Same Fonts as Other Applications and select one font for standard typefaces and a second for monospace, terminal, or display. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="2393">Message Display: </p>
<p xid="2394">Choose how long you want to wait before marking a message read, how to highlight quotations, and the default encoding.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="2395">Deleting Mail: </p>
<p xid="2396">Choose whether to delete messages automatically when quitting Evolution, and whether you want to explicitly confirm the final deletion of messages. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="2397">New Mail Notifications: </p>
<p xid="2398">Evolution can alert you to the arrival of new mail with a beep or by playing a sound file. Choose your alert noise, or select none, as you prefer. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="2399">HTML Mail Preferences</p>
<p xid="2400">The HTML Mail page has the following options:</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="2401">Show Animated Images: </p>
<p xid="2402">Turns animation on or off. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="2403">Prompt When Sending HTML Messages to Contacts That Don't Want Them: </p>
<p xid="2404">Some people do not like HTML mail, and you can set Evolution to warn you of this preference. This warning appears only when you send HTML mail to people in your contacts who are listed as disliking HTML. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="2405">Loading Images: </p>
<p xid="2406">You can embed a image in an e-mail and have it load only when the message arrives. However, spammers can use image loading patterns to confirm live addresses and invade your privacy. You can elect to never load images automatically, to load images only if the sender is in your contacts, or always load images. </p>
<p xid="2407">If you have chosen not to load images automatically, you can choose to see the images in one message at a time by selecting View &gt; Message Display &gt; Load Images. </p>
<p xid="2408">The Colors tab lets you select different color labels for individual messages. Return to the default settings by clicking Restore Defaults.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="2409">Color Preferences</p>
<p xid="2410">The Mail Color preferences tool lets you select color labels for different kinds of messages. Click a color to change the color, or change the label associated with that color. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="2411">Mail Header Preferences</p>
<p xid="2412">The headers on an incoming message are the information about the message that isn't the content of the message itself, such as the sender and the time it was sent. Select the options here to show or hide different amounts of information about the messages you read. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="2413">Junk Mail Preferences</p>
<p xid="2414">There are only two items in this section: Check Incoming Mail for Junk and Include Remote Tests. Checking for junk mail uses the SpamAssassin tool with trainable Bayesian filters. It also includes online tests, like checking for blacklisted message senders and ISPs. Online tests can make filtering slower, but more accurate. Select the options here to choose your mail filtering method. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="2415">Automatic Contacts Preferences</p>
<p xid="2416">There are two items in this section: Automatic Contacts automatically adds people that you respond to into your address book. Instant Messaging Contacts periodically synchronizes contact information and images with your instant messaging program. Currently this only works with Gaim. For both these features to work properly, the address book must have write permissions set.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="2417">Meetings &amp; Tasks Preferences</p>
<p xid="2418">Allows you to delete messages after you have acted on an appointment. It also allows you to select calendars to search for meeting conflicts.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="2419">Composer Preferences</p>
<p xid="2420">There are three pages for settings you can change for the message composer. The General page covers shortcuts and assorted behavior, the Signature page controls your signature, and the Spell Checking page controls spell checking. </p>
<p xid="2421"><a xlink:href="#bshpixy" xid="2422">General</a></p>
<p xid="2424"><a xlink:href="#bshpjpl" xid="2425">Signature</a></p>
<p xid="2427"><a xlink:href="#bshpjuj" xid="2428">Spell Checking</a></p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="2430">General</p>
<p xid="2431">In the General page, you can set the following options:</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="2432">Default Behavior: </p>
<p xid="2433">Choose how to normally forward and reply to messages, what character set they will use, whether they are in HTML, and whether that HTML can contain graphic emoticons.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="2434">Alerts: </p>
<p xid="2435">There are two optional alerts you can select:</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="2436">Prompt When Sending Messages With an Empty Subject Line:</p>
<p xid="2437"> The composer warns you if you try to send a message without a subject. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="2438">Prompt When Sending Messages with Only Bcc Recipients Defined:</p>
<p xid="2439"> The composer warns you if you try to send a message that has only Bcc recipients. This is important because some mail servers fail to transmit blind carbon copy if you do not have at least one recipient that is visible to all readers. </p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="2440">Signature</p>
<p xid="2441">The signature editor allows you to create several different signatures in plain text or in HTML, and to specify which of them will be added to e-mail you create in the message composer. If you prefer to use an alternate signature or none at all, you can select it from the mail composer itself.</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="2442">Spell Checking</p>
<p xid="2443">To choose a spell-checking language, select it here. You must install the gnome-spell package, available through ZENworks Linux Management, for spell-checking to be available in Evolution. Additional dictionaries are also available through Red Carpet and are detected automatically if you have installed them. To have the composer automatically check your spelling while you type, select Check Spelling While I Type.</p>
<p xid="2444">Check the spelling in messages by clicking Edit &gt; Spell Check Document. </p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="2445">Calendar and Tasks Settings</p>
<p xid="2446">The calendar configuration tool has four pages:</p>

<p style="Heading 1" xid="2489">Alarms</p>
<p style="Heading 1" xid="2490">Select the Calendars for Alarm Notification:</p>

<p xid="2582">After your computer and your Palm OS device are communicating, select the <a xlink:href="#conduit" xid="2583">conduits</a> you want under the Pilot Conduits section of the Control Center. You can use conduits to synchronize data with several applications; the Evolution conduits are labeled EAddress, for the contacts in your address book; ECalendar, for your calendar; and ETodo, for your task list.</p>
<p xid="2585">Click Enable, then click Settings to change what the conduit does when activated. Your options can vary depending on the conduit, but typically they are as follows:</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="2586">Disabled: </p>
<p xid="2587">Do nothing.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="2588">Synchronize: </p>
<p xid="2589">Copy new data from the computer to the handheld, and from the handheld to the computer. Remove items that were on both systems but have been deleted on one.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="2590">Copy From Pilot: </p>
<p xid="2591">If there is any new data on the handheld device, copy it to the computer.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="2592">Copy To Pilot: </p>
<p xid="2593">Copy new data from the computer to the handheld. </p>
<p xid="2594">Select the behavior you want for each conduit you choose to use. If you're not sure, use Synchronize.</p>
<p style="Section Heading" xid="2595">Synchronizing Information</p>
<p xid="2596">Use the following procedure to synchronize the data on your Palm OS device with the data you store in Evolution.</p>
<p xid="2597">If you want to back up your information before synchronizing, make a copy of the evolution directory inside your home directory.</p>
<p xid="2598">Put your handheld device in its cradle and press the HotSync button.</p>
<p xid="2599">If you use Palm OS v. 4.0 and have password protection turned on for your handheld device, you might encounter trouble synchronizing. If this happens, try turning off password protection on your handheld, synchronize it with your desktop computer, and then re-enable password protection on your handheld.</p>
<p xid="2600">If you have followed the setup instructions properly, your Palm OS device will synchronize data with Evolution.</p>
<p xid="2601">If you are using Microsoft Outlook, but not Microsoft Exchange, this section helps you switch to Evolution.</p>
<p style="Chapter Heading" xid="2602">Migrating Local Outlook Mail Folders</p>
<p xid="2603">Exchange and IMAP mail is stored on the server, so you do not need to migrate it to your Linux partition. However, if you have stored mail on your computer, you might want to make it accessible to Evolution.</p>
<p xid="2604">First, while using Windows, prepare your messages for import:</p>
<p xid="2605">Clean up your mail. Delete messages and folders you do not need, and click File &gt; Folders &gt; Properties &gt; Advanced &gt; Compact to erase old, deleted messages from your PST file.</p>
<p xid="2606">If you nest your folders one inside another, you might want to rename subfolders so that you can tell which folder they belong to. You must re-nest them after you load them into Evolution.</p>
<p xid="2607">Import the files into Mozilla Mail (or another mailer, such as Netscape or Eudora, that uses the standard mbox format).</p>
<p xid="2608">Linux mailers cannot do this task, because it requires a library available only under Windows. In Mozilla, import by selecting Window Mail &amp; Newsgroups Tools Import.</p>
<p xid="2609">Mozilla creates a set of files in the directory Windows\Application_Data\Mozilla\Profiles\(UserName)\(Random Letters)\Mail\Local Folders\OutlookMail\. The data files are those that have no file extension.</p>
<p xid="2610">If you are using Windows XP or Windows 2000, your Windows hard drive is probably in the NTFS format, which some Linux systems cannot read without additional software. You might find it simpler to copy the mail folders to a different drive or to burn a CD.</p>
<p xid="2611">When you have your mail in a format Evolution can understand, reboot to Linux. Then continue with the following procedure. To create new folders for your files:</p>
<p xid="2612">Mount your Windows drive or the disk where you saved the mail files.</p>
<p xid="2613">Copy all the mail files into your home directory or another convenient place.</p>
<p xid="2614">Start Evolution.</p>
<p xid="2615">Press Shift+Ctrl+F or select File &gt; New Folder to create the folders you want.</p>
<p xid="2616">To import the data files:</p>
<p xid="2617">In Evolution, open the File Import assistant by clicking File &gt; Import.</p>
<p xid="2618">Click Next, then select Import A Single File.</p>
<p xid="2619">Leave the file type as Automatic, then click Browse to select the data file. </p>
<p xid="2620">Remember, the data files are the files that have no file extension.</p>
<p xid="2621">Select the folder where you want to put the imported data file.</p>
<p xid="2622">Click OK.</p>
<p xid="2623">Repeat the import steps until you have imported all your mail.</p>
<p xid="2624">You can print this section to use it as a quick reference for most of the things you want to do with Evolution.</p>

<p xid="2710">This glossary contains terms that are frequently used in this guide as well as in Evolution.</p>
<p xid="2711">A tool that guides a user through a series of steps, usually to configure or set up a program. Equivalent to Wizard and Druid.</p>
<p xid="2712">Any file sent with an e-mail. Attachments can be embedded in a message or appended to it.</p>
<p xid="2713">A pre-downloading procedure that allows Novell Evolution to quickly refer to data. It enables faster searches and decreases memory usage for data displays.</p>
<p xid="2714">Blind copy recipients (Bcc) receive a copy of an item. Other recipients receive no information about blind copies. Only the sender and the blind copy recipient know that a blind copy was sent. If a recipient replies and chooses Reply to All, the blind copy recipient does not receive the reply.</p>
<p xid="2715">Carbon copy recipients (CC) receive a copy of an item. CC recipients are users who would benefit from the information in an item, but are not affected by or directly responsible for it. All recipients can see that a carbon copy was sent. They can also see the names of the CC recipients.</p>
<p xid="2716">A small application that controls the transfer of data between a handheld device and a desktop computer.</p>
<p xid="2717">The GNOME groupware application.</p>
<p xid="2718">To run a program. Any file that can be run is called an executable. Evolution can download executable attachments, but before they can be run, the files must be marked as executable with a shell or file manager. This security precaution prevents the automatic or accidental execution of malicious programs. For more information on executables and file permissions, see the documentation for your file manager or shell.</p>
<p xid="2719">When messages are marked for deletion, they remain until they are expunged. When a message is expunged, it is permanently deleted, as long as it was marked for deletion.</p>
<p xid="2720">A way of describing a group of files on a computer. The top of the tree is called the root directory, and is denoted by /. The rest of the branches spread downward from the root. Don't confuse the root directory with the root account or root's home directory, normally /root.</p>
<p xid="2721">Within Evolution, a filter is a method of sorting mail automatically when it's downloaded. You can create filters to perform one or more actions on a message that meets any (or all) of a wide range of criteria.</p>
<p xid="2722">Forwards a copy of the message and any additional comments to a different e-mail address. </p>
<p xid="2723">A term describing an application that helps groups of people work together. Typically, a groupware application has several productivity features built into one program, including e-mail, calendar, and address book tools.</p>
<p xid="2724">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a language for describing page layout in electronic documents such as Web pages, help files, and e-mail messages. HTML can be used in e-mail and news posts to insert images and apply text treatments.</p>
<p xid="2725">iCal is a protocol that Evolution uses to manage the calendar section.</p>
<p xid="2726">Internet Mail Access Protocol. It allows access to e-mail that is typically stored remotely on a server rather than on a local hard disk. Often contrasted with POP. </p>
<p xid="2727">Displayed as part of a message or other document, rather than attached as a separate file. Contrast with <c props="font-style:italic">attachment</c>.</p>
<p xid="2728">Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. Allows a client to search through a large database of addresses, phone numbers, and people stored on a server.</p>
<p xid="2729">The application with which a person reads and sends e-mail. Its counterparts are the various types of mail servers, which handle user authentication and direct messages from the sender to the recipient.</p>
<p xid="2730">Post Office Protocol. A mechanism for e-mail transport. In contrast to IMAP, it is used only to get mail from a server and store it locally on your hard disk.</p>
<p xid="2731">An agreed-upon method of communication, especially one for sending particular types of information between computer systems. Examples include POP (Post Office Protocol), for e-mail, and HTTP (HypterText Transfer Protocol) for Web pages.</p>
<p xid="2732">A strong encryption method that uses a set of two keys, one of which is made public, and one of which is kept private. Data encrypted using the public key can only be decrypted using the private key. The longer the keys, the more difficult it is to break the encryption.</p>
<p xid="2733">A regular expression (regex) is a way of describing a string of text using metacharacters or wildcard symbols. For example, the statement fly.*so[au]p means any phrase beginning with fly and ending in oup or soap. If you searched for that expression, you'd find both fly in my soup and fly in my soap. For more information, enter man grep from the command line.</p>
<p xid="2734">A program written in an interpreted (rather than compiled) language. Often used as a synonym for macro, to denote a series of prerecorded commands or actions within an application. Scripts are used to accomplish repetitive and tedious tasks, to save the user time.</p>
<p xid="2735">LDAP can break contact lists into many groups. The search base tells LDAP the top group to use. How much of the Search Base to search is set by the Search Scope option.</p>
<p xid="2736">An e-mail organization tool. Search folders allow you to create a folder that contains the results of a complex search. search folder contents are updated dynamically.</p>
<p xid="2737">Search Scope states how much of the search base to search.</p>
<p xid="2738">A program that sends mail. Evolution can use it instead of SMTP; some people prefer it because it offers more flexibility; however, it is more difficult to set up.</p>
<p xid="2739">An area of Evolution that offers users fast access to the most frequently used features of the application.</p>
<p xid="2740">Text placed at the end of every e-mail sent, similar to a hand-written signature at the bottom of a written letter. A signature can be anything from a favorite quotation to a link to a Web page; courtesy dictates that it be fewer than four lines long.</p>
<p xid="2741">Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. The most common way of transporting mail messages from your computer to the server.</p>
<p xid="2742">A small box of explanatory text that appears when the mouse pointer is held over a button or other interface element.</p>
<p xid="2743">A program that inserts itself into other files or programs. When executed, it spreads to more programs and other computers. A virus can cause substantial damage by clogging networks or disk drives, deleting files, or opening security holes.</p>
<p xid="2744">A file format for the exchange of contact information. When you get an address card attached to an e-mail, it's probably in vCard format. Contrast with search folder.</p>
