<title>Publishing DocBook Documents</title>

<para>Creating and editing &SGML;/&XML; documents is usually only half the
battle. After you've composed your document, you'll want to publish
it. Publishing, for our purposes, means either print or web
publishing. For &SGML; and &XML; documents, this is usually
accomplished with some kind of <glossterm>stylesheet</glossterm>.  In
the (not too distant) future, you may be able to publish an &XML;
document on the Web by simply putting it online with a stylesheet, but
for now you'll probably have to translate your document into &HTML;.
